"FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME","Hello! !I see you've found your way to the portal. My name is Ada. I'm going to show you around!

You look like a curious person. First things first: Let's talk about how to change technology to do what you want.  

See that button to the left? It's the ""Flip to Hack"" button. Click on it.","Ada"
"FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL","To enter The Conservatory, you need to perform your 1st hack.

See that wave? Match it by moving the slider and the doors will unlock.",""
"FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK","Congrats! You've got your first real hack under your belt! Okay, let's get right back in there. Exactly, you're on it! Click that Flip to Hack button.",""
"FIRSTCONTACT_REWARD","That's how you'll do a lot of things around here.  See you on the other side!",""
"ROSTER_QUESTION","Hello! Welcome to the Clubhouse. Let's go inside and see what's up.","Ada"
"ROSTER_RESPONSE","Ready! ",""
"ROSTER_PRELAUNCH","The Clubhouse is where you'll find me and the rest of the crew. I do my research here – fighting rogue AIs!

Stick with me and I'll show you how to do things around here.",""
"ROSTER_LAUNCH","I'm giving you a new app called Roster. See it in the desktop? Go ahead and launch it.",""
"ROSTER_EXPLANATION","Roster helps you get to know our crew here: Riley, Saniel, Aurora, Faber, and me! Check it out!",""
"ROSTER_CLOSED","Come get me in the Clubhouse and we'll continue your tour.","This happens when the player closes the app."
"ROSTER_TIMEOUT","Have fun looking around. Come get me in the Clubhouse whenever you're ready and we'll continue your tour.","And this happens when the player spends more than 2 minutes in the app without closing it."
"FIZZICSINTRO_QUESTION","Okay, Ace. You're a quick learner! Want to try out this new game I'm working on? ","Ada"
"FIZZICSINTRO_RESPONSE","Yep! Let's go. ",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_LAUNCH","I'm researching the physics of the bounce. Kinetic energy. Velocity. I can tell you more sometime! 

You can learn so much about the world just by looking at how a ball bounces. This game helps me with that research.

You can see it on the desktop. Launch the Fizzics app.",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_EXPLANATION","Fizzics not only helps me with my research but everyone just wants to play with it because it's fun to see what happens. ",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_RICKY","Hey! Welcome ;)  OMG. Fizzics. I love this game. It's my total fave. ","Riley"
"FIZZICSINTRO_INTRO","Oh, hey Riley! This is Riley, one of our students. Definitely an important person to know! I'm sure you two will be pals.

Take as long as you want to just play around. Try out different strategies. See what's possible! 

We'll meet back at the Clubhouse.","Ada"
"FIZZICS1_QUESTION","Hey! So I prepared this special challenge just for you in the Fizzics game. Think you can beat it?","Riley"
"FIZZICS1_RESPONSE","Bring it on!",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCH","All right. Let's try it. Launch the Fizzics game to get started.",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCHHINT","See the Fizzics app on the desktop? Click it to launch. ","Played 20 seconds after quest start if they haven't launched it yet."
"FIZZICS1_ALREADY_RUNNING","Ah! I see you're already running Fizzics. You read my mind!",""
"FIZZICS1_GOAL","Cool. See those 20 spiky balls? Your goal is to make it so they don't touch each other.",""
"FIZZICS1_EXPLANATION","Just wanted to see if you were paying attention. It's actually impossible to do it that way! 

You're gonna need to get in there and hack the game in order to get it to do what you want.",""
"FIZZICS1_GIVE_KEY1","This key will get you into the Level 1 Hacking Panel. From there, there are loads of cool things you can do to solve this.",""
"FIZZICS1_HINT","The spiky balls are constantly touching each other. Think about it. What if they were smaller? Try to get them not to touch.",""
"FIZZICS1_NOTENOUGH","Hey, wait! Nice try, but you need to keep at least 20 red balls, otherwise it doesn't count.",""
"FIZZICS1_SUCCESS","Brilliant! I knew you'd ace that. Fun, isn't it?

Since you're clearly such a natural at this, I'm going to let you in on a secret:",""
"FIZZICS1_KEY_ALREADY_OS","Check out this key I found the other day. We can use it to get into the Level 1 Hacking Panel of the System!!","This is if you've already visited the OS with Ada"
"FIZZICS1_KEY_NO_OS","Check out this key I found the other day. It says ""System Level 1"" on it. I wonder what that is.","And this is if you haven't seen the OS, so you don't know what it is."
"FIZZICS1_GIVE_KEY2","Here, I'm entrusting this key to you. Keep it safe and don't let anyone lay eyes on it. 

Gotta go! See you at the Clubhouse!",""
"FIZZICS1_ABORT","Check ya later! Let's play again soon. You know where to find me! ","This should be one line. Don't want multiple steps when they've lost interest."
"OSINTRO_QUESTION","The System is a super important place. Would you like to see it now?","Ada"
"OSINTRO_RESPONSE","Absolutely!","Simple version for now. Later we can detect whether they tried to flip it or not and have alternate paths for the Archivist intro."
"OSINTRO_LAUNCH","Okay, so now you'll see an icon for the System on the desktop. Go ahead and launch it.",""
"OSINTRO_EXPLANATION","The System keeps everything running smoothly. You have to be very careful back here. 

But it's really cool to be able to adjust things and have a say in how your computer works. ",""
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST","What's all this ruckus? Oh, it's you, Ada. Finding anything interesting while you're here? And who's this with you? ","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST_FLIP","What's this? Who let you in here? Don't you know you're not supposed to try to access this part?","Archivist (if player tried to flip panel)"
"OSINTRO_INTRO","Hello Dr. Rowe. This is our new student. This is Saniel, the Archivist. He keeps things in order around here. 

He's kind of scary at first, but no one knows more about the System than Saniel. 

Also, I'll tell you more sometime, but Saniel a quite the hero!","Ada"
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST2","Hero schmero. Anyway, hello! Ada is one of our most brilliant students, but I'm afraid she's filling your head with ancient history! 

Though it's true, I've been around a while and I do know a few things about keeping the systems clear of trouble.

But hear me when I say you must never come here alone. Only with an adult. I'll be keeping my eye out for any shenanigans.","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_WRAPUP","See what I mean, he's a bit fierce! But so glad you could meet him. Okay, gotta bounce now! 

Just come get me at the Clubhouse if you want to look around! ","Ada"
"OSINTRO_ABORT","Come back to the Clubhouse when you want to finish learning about the System.",""
"BREAK_QUESTION","Psssst! I was hoping I'd see you. Wanna go scope around in the System with that key we found?","Ricky"
"BREAK_RESPONSE","Definitely. ",""
"BREAK_LAUNCH","Ok. So you just need to launch the System app now and we're golden. ",""
"BREAK_OSAPP","Awesome. This place is LIT. Okay we have to be extremely quiet. We don't want Saniel knowing we're here. 

He seems to be able to hear everything that goes on here. Ssshhhh. I think I hear him.

Ok, remember the Flip to Hack button? Now press it. ",""
"BREAK_UNLOCK","Perfect. Now click on that to unlock it. I wonder what's behind it?",""
"BREAK_UNLOCKED","Rad! We can have so much fun with all those settings.

Check it out. That one changes the cursor size. Try changing it all the way to 200 to make it huge! LOLLZZ",""
"BREAK_SUCCESS","OMG we have to stop laughing or San will hear us. Uh-oh. That´s pretty unusable. What's that noise?

Oh, hi Dr. Rowe. We're just, er, studying!",""
"BREAK_ARCHIVISTARRIVES","I just told you this is no place for novices! Do you realize what you could do if you pressed the wrong buttons? 

I know you want to learn how it all works. Ada's been giving me such glowing reports about you so I'll let it pass this time. 

It's not too late to fix this. If you press the reset button, it will return you to the original settings. ","Archivist"
"BREAK_WRAPUP","Good job restoring the settings! Glad you know about the reset button now. 

Keep it handy for when you need to clean up messes like this one! ",""
"BREAK_ABORT","No prob! We can try again later. ","If player exits the OS app before completing the quest."
"FIZZICS2_QUESTION","I'll give you a key I found if you beat a Fizzics challenge I prepared for you.",""
"FIZZICS2_RESPONSE","Thanks! ",""
"FIZZICS2_LAUNCH","Good. Launch the Fizzics app and let's play!",""
"FIZZICS2_ALREADY_RUNNING","You're already running Fizzics. Bring it up and let's play!",""
"FIZZICS2_GOAL","This time I prepared something a little bit more challenging for you. But I know you can do it!

See those 10 green balls? You need to make sure they're touching that red ball at the same time.",""
"FIZZICS2_NOTENOUGH","You need to have at least 10 green balls and exactly 1 red ball.",""
"FIZZICS2_SUCCESS","Yay! That's a really cool solution. You've got a talent for this! I didn't think of that one.

Here's the key I found. I think it must have fallen out of Saniel's pocket.",""
"FIZZICS2_ABORT","No prob. We can try it some other time.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT1","Start by launching the Fizzics app on the desktop.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT2","Looks like stacking them up isn't going to work. Try going back in and hacking the app and changing the forces between ball types.",""
"HACKDEX1_QUESTION","Well Hello there. Something very peculiar is happening with the roster. Can you have a look at it with me?","Archivist"
"HACKDEX1_RESPONSE","I'd love to. ",""
"HACKDEX1_LAUNCH","My Roster is behaving strangely. I think something has gotten in and corrupted it. Check to see if yours is okay. 

So let's see how this goes. Launch the Hackdex app.",""
"HACKDEX1_GOAL","Curses! Yours too! That's very strange. I wonder what's causing this. Your goal is to fix it so everything is readable again.",""
"HACKDEX1_NEED_KEY","You need the key to get to level one, but it appears I have misplaced it.",""
"HACKDEX1_UNLOCKED","Excellent! I see you've found the key! Good, good. Now, get in there and do your magic and fix this corruption.",""
"HACKDEX1_SUCCESS","Ah, that's better. Your solution is acceptable. You've earned this. Take it.",""
"HACKDEX1_AFTERKEY","It will let you start doing some actual coding to keep your skills sharp. See you at the Clubhouse.",""
"HACKDEX1_RICKY","That was cool how you did that. Wait a sec, what's this?

How did this get into the Roster? Or did the Archivist drop it again? Weird. Keep it anyway. I'm sure we can use it!

It's been fun to explore things with you! Hope you'll come back ;) ","Ricky"
"HACKDEX1_ABORT","All done already? Okay then, Come back soon. We've got our work cut out for us!","Archivist"
"LOSTFILES_QUESTION","Hey there, glad you're here, but I'm dealing with a situation. Everything's gone. All my research files have just disappeared! ","Ada"
"LOSTFILES_ANSWER","Whoa. What does that even mean? ",""
"LOSTFILES_EXPLANATION","Explain what's going on. Blah blah blah.

This wraps up Act 1 blah blah.",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_RICKY","I think Riley was looking for you earlier.","These are the comments characters make when they don't have a quest to give you. For now they just tell you to go talk to another character (if there is one)."
"NOQUEST_ADA_ARCHIVIST","Dr. Rowe wants to talk to you.",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_NOTHING","Are you enjoying yourself?",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_CHAPTER1END","We're still investigating how my research was corrupted.","This is what the characters say when the whole chapter is over and there's nothing to do."
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ADA","Hey, I think Ada wants to tell you something.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ARCHIVIST","Psss... The Archivist is looking for you.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_NOTHING","What are you up to?",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_CHAPTER1END","It looks like everybody is busy with the investigation. That's no fun.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_ADA","Perhaps you should inquire with Ada.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_RICKY","That friend of yours is probably up to no good.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_NOTHING","Stay out of trouble!",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_CHAPTER1END","Shhhh!... We're busy right now.",""
"","Yellow: I had to add/modify the text. Needs to be looked at by Genine.",""
