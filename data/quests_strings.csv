"FIZZICSINTRO_QUESTION","Hello again! Welcome to the Clubhouse. Let me show you a game I'm making.","Ada"
"FIZZICSINTRO_RESPONSE","Sounds fun!",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_LAUNCH","You can learn so much about physics just by watching  how a ball bounces. Kinetic energy. Velocity. It's all there!

See the Fizzics app on the desktop? Go ahead and launch it now.",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_EXPLANATION","Fizzics helps me with my research but I'm also glad everyone just wants to play it!

Give it a try. Take out the slingshot and try to reach level 3.",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_SUCCESS","Well done! I knew you could do it.","Ada"
"FIZZICSINTRO_RICKY","Hey! Welcome ;)  OMG. Fizzics. I love this game. It's my total fave. It's fun seeing how balls all act in different ways.","Riley"
"FIZZICSINTRO_INTRO","Oh, hey Riley! This is Riley, one of our students. She's definitely an important person to know around here!","Ada"
"FIZZICSINTRO_KEY","I'm giving you this key in case you want to dig deeper into Fizzics.

See you back at the Clubhouse!",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_ABORT","We can do it later. Come get me at the Clubhouse whenever you feel like it.",""
"FIZZICS1_QUESTION","I bet you can't get to the level I'm on Fizzics.",""
"FIZZICS1_REPONSE","Let's see",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCH","All right. Let's try it. Launch the Fizzics game to get started.",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCHHINT","See the Fizzics app on the desktop? Click it to launch. ",""
"FIZZICS1_ALREADY_RUNNING","Ah! I see you're already running Fizzics. Great. ",""
"FIZZICS1_GOAL","OK, first get to Level 8. That's where the real challenge starts.",""
"FIZZICS1_LEVEL8","Here we are. Think you can beat it?",""
"FIZZICS1_HINT","You're gonna need to hack the game to beat it. Press the Flip to Hack button.",""
"FIZZICS1_FLIPPED","Use the key that Ada gave you earlier. Click on that lock to access the hack panel.",""
"FIZZICS1_HACK","Perfect. I'm sure you can beat the level if you make a few changes.",""
"FIZZICS1_SUCCESS","Brilliant! I knew you'd ace that. 

Since you're clearly such a natural at this, I'm going to let you in on a secret:",""
"FIZZICS1_KEY_ALREADY_OS","Check out this key I found the other day. We can use it to get into the Level 1 Hacking Panel of the System!!","This is if you've already visited the OS with Ada"
"FIZZICS1_KEY_NO_OS","Check out this key I found the other day. It says ""System Level 1"" on it. I wonder what that is.","And this is if you haven't seen the OS, so you don't know what it is."
"FIZZICS1_GIVE_KEY2","Here, I'm entrusting this key to you. Keep it safe and don't let anyone lay eyes on it. 

Gotta go! See you at the Clubhouse!",""
"FIZZICS1_ABORT","Check ya later! Let's play again soon. You know where to find me! ",""
"OSINTRO_QUESTION","The System is a super important place. Would you like to see it now?","Ada"
"OSINTRO_RESPONSE","Absolutely!","Simple version for now. Later we can detect whether they tried to flip it or not and have alternate paths for the Archivist intro."
"OSINTRO_LAUNCH","Okay, so now you'll see an icon for the System on the desktop. Go ahead and launch it.",""
"OSINTRO_EXPLANATION","The System keeps everything running smoothly. You have to be very careful back here. 

But it's really cool to be able to adjust things and have some input in how your computer works. ",""
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST","What's all this ruckus? Oh, it's you, Ada. Finding anything interesting while you're here? And who's this with you? ","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST_FLIP","What's this? Who let you in here? Don't you know you're not supposed to try to access this part?","Archivist (if player tried to flip panel)"
"OSINTRO_INTRO","Hello Dr. Rowe. This is our new student. This is Saniel, the Archivist. He keeps things in order around here. 

He's kind of scary at first, but no one knows more about the System than Saniel. 

Also, I'll tell you more sometime, but Saniel a quite the hero!","Ada"
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST2","Hero schmero. Anyway, hello! Ada is one of our most brilliant students, but I'm afraid she's filling your head with ancient history! 

It's true though. I've been around a while and I do know a few things about keeping the systems clear of trouble.

But hear me when I say you must never come here alone. Only with an adult. Got it? I'll be keeping my eye out for any shenanigans.","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_WRAPUP","See what I mean, he's a bit fierce! But so glad you could meet him. Well, I must bounce now! Gotta get back to my research.  

Just come get me at the Clubhouse if you want to look around! ","Ada"
"OSINTRO_ABORT","Come back to the Clubhouse when you want to finish learning about the System.",""
"BREAK_QUESTION","Psssst! I was hoping I'd see you. Wanna go scope around in the System with that key we found?","Riley"
"BREAK_RESPONSE","Definitely. ",""
"BREAK_LAUNCH","Ok. So you just need to launch the System app now and we're golden. ",""
"BREAK_OSAPP","Awesome. This place is LIT. Okay we have to be extremely quiet. We don't want Saniel knowing we're here. 

He seems to be able to hear everything that goes on here. Ssshhhh. I think I hear him.

Ok, remember the Flip to Hack button? Now press it. ",""
"BREAK_UNLOCK","Perfect. Now click on that to unlock it. I wonder what's behind it?",""
"BREAK_UNLOCKED","Rad! We can have so much fun playing around with the settings.

Check it out. That one changes the cursor size. Try changing it all the way to 200 to make it huge! LOLLZZ",""
"BREAK_SUCCESS","OMG we have to stop laughing or San will hear us. Uh-oh. Now we've made it so big it doesn't work! What's that noise?

Oh, hi Dr. Rowe. We're just, er, studying!",""
"BREAK_ARCHIVISTARRIVES","I just told you this is no place for novices! Do you realize what you could do if you pressed the wrong buttons? 

I know you want to learn how it all works. Ada's been giving me such glowing reports about you so I'll let it pass this time. 

It's not too late to fix this. I'm enabling the Reset Button. When you press it, it will return you to the original settings.","Archivist"
"BREAK_WRAPUP","Good job restoring the settings! Glad you know about the reset button now. 

Keep it handy for when you need to clean up messes like this one! ",""
"BREAK_ABORT","No prob! We can try again later. ","If player exits the OS app before completing the quest."
"ROSTER_QUESTION","Want to check out the Roster?","Ada"
"ROSTER_RESPONSE","Sure!",""
"ROSTER_PRELAUNCH","You can always go back to the Clubhouse and find me and the rest of the crew there. 

That's where I do my research â€“ fighting rogue Artificial Intelligence. We call them AI's around here. ",""
"ROSTER_LAUNCH","I'm giving you a new app called Roster. See it in the desktop? Go ahead and launch it.",""
"ROSTER_EXPLANATION","You'll find alot of cool info about our crew here. Check it out!",""
"ROSTER_CLOSED","Come get me in the Clubhouse and we'll continue your tour.","This happens when the player closes the app."
"ROSTER_TIMEOUT","Have fun looking around. Come get me in the Clubhouse whenever you're ready and we'll continue your tour.","And this happens when the player spends more than 2 minutes in the app without closing it."
"FIZZICS2_QUESTION","I'll give you a key I found if you beat a Fizzics challenge I prepared for you.",""
"FIZZICS2_RESPONSE","Thanks! ",""
"FIZZICS2_LAUNCH","Good. Launch the Fizzics app and let's play!",""
"FIZZICS2_ALREADY_RUNNING","You're already running Fizzics. Bring it up and let's play!",""
"FIZZICS2_GOAL","This time I prepared something a little bit more challenging for you. But I know you can do it!

See those 10 green balls? You need to make sure they're touching that red ball at the same time.",""
"FIZZICS2_NOTENOUGH","You need to have at least 10 green balls and exactly 1 red ball.",""
"FIZZICS2_SUCCESS","Yay! That's a really cool solution. You've got a talent for this! I didn't think of that one.

Here's the key I found. I think it must have fallen out of Saniel's pocket.",""
"FIZZICS2_ABORT","No prob. We can try it some other time.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT1","Start by launching the Fizzics app on the desktop.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT2","Looks like stacking them up isn't going to work. Try going back in and hacking the app and changing the forces between ball types.",""
"HACKDEX1_QUESTION","Well Hello there. Something very peculiar is happening with the roster. Can you have a look at it with me?","Archivist"
"HACKDEX1_RESPONSE","I'd love to. ",""
"HACKDEX1_LAUNCH","My Roster is behaving strangely. I think something has gotten in and corrupted it. Check to see if yours is okay. 

So let's see how this goes. Launch the Hackdex app.",""
"HACKDEX1_GOAL","Curses! Yours too! That's very strange. I wonder what's causing this. Your goal is to fix it so everything is readable again.",""
"HACKDEX1_NEED_KEY","You need the key to get to level one, but it appears I have misplaced it.",""
"HACKDEX1_UNLOCKED","Excellent! I see you've found the key! Good, good. Now, get in there and do your magic and fix this corruption.",""
"HACKDEX1_SUCCESS","Ah, that's better. Your solution is acceptable. You've earned this. Take it.",""
"HACKDEX1_AFTERKEY","This key will let you start doing some actual coding to keep your skills sharp. See you at the Clubhouse.",""
"HACKDEX1_RICKY","That was cool how you did that. Wait a sec, what's this?

How did this get into the Roster? Or did the Archivist drop it again? Weird. Keep it anyway. I'm sure we can use it!

It's been fun to explore things with you! Hope you'll come back ;) ","Riley"
"HACKDEX1_ABORT","All done already? Okay then, Come back soon. We've got our work cut out for us!","Archivist"
"LOSTFILES_QUESTION","Hey, I'm dealing with a serious situation here. Everything's gone. ","Ada"
"LOSTFILES_ANSWER","Whoa. What happened? ",""
"LOSTFILES_EXPLANATION","I've been studying these rogue AI's and now they've gotten loose. And all my daily logs. Gone!

I'm the only one with access to those tanks. What's more troubling is that there's no sign of how anyone got in. Or out! ",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_RICKY","I think Riley was looking for you earlier.","These are the comments characters make when they don't have a quest to give you. For now they just tell you to go talk to another character (if there is one)."
"NOQUEST_ADA_ARCHIVIST","Dr. Rowe wants to talk to you.",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_NOTHING","Are you enjoying yourself?",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_CHAPTER1END","We're still trying to get to the bottom of what's happening with Ada's data!","This is what the characters say when the whole chapter is over and there's nothing to do."
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ADA","Hey, I think Ada wants to tell you something.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ARCHIVIST","Psss... The Archivist is looking for you.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_NOTHING","What are you up to?",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_CHAPTER1END","It looks like everybody's wrapped up in recovering Ada's missing packets. That's no fun.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_ADA","Perhaps you should inquire with Ada.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_RICKY","That friend of yours is probably up to no good.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_NOTHING","Stay out of trouble!",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_CHAPTER1END","Shhhh!... We're busy right now.",""
"","Yellow: I had to add/modify the text. Needs to be looked at by Genine.",""
