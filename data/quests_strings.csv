"FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME","Oh, hello there! So glad you're here! I see you've found your way to the portal. My name is Ada & I'm going to show you around. You look like a curious person. Do you want to learn how to change technology to do what you want? 
Here's the first step: see that button to the left? It's the ""Flip to Hack"" button. Click on it.","Ada"
"FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL","In order to get into The Conservatory, you need to perform your first hack.
See that wave? Match it by moving the slider and the doors will unlock.",""
"FIRSTCONTACT_REWARD","Perfect. You did it. That was your first real hack. Congrats! Get used to it, because that's how you'll do a lot of things around here.  See you on the other side.
",""
"ROSTER_QUESTION","Hello! Welcome to the Clubhouse. Let me show you around.","Ada"
"ROSTER_RESPONSE","Ready! ",""
"ROSTER_PRELAUNCH","The Clubhouse is where you'll find me and other members of the Conservatory.
This is where I do my research to help fight rogue AIs.
If you stick with me, we'll check out how to do things around here.",""
"ROSTER_LAUNCH","I'm giving you a new app called Roster. Do you see it in the desktop? Go ahead and launch it.",""
"ROSTER_EXPLANATION","This is the Roster. You can see our crew here. Riley, Saniel, Delta, Faber, and me! You can learn more about us all here.
Have a look at it and come get me in the Clubhouse whenever you're ready to continue your tour.",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_QUESTION","Okay, Ace. You're a quick learner! Ready to keep learning about this?","Ada"
"FIZZICSINTRO_RESPONSE","Yep! Let's go. ",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_LAUNCH","I'm researching the physics of the bounce. Kinetic energy. Velocity. I can tell you more sometime! You would not believe how much you can learn about the world just by looking at how a ball bounces. So I made a game to help me with that research.
You can see it on the desktop. Launch the Fizzics app.",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_EXPLANATION","Fizzics not only helps me with my research but everyone just wants to play with it because it's just fun to see what happens. ",""
"FIZZICSINTRO_RICKY","Hey! Welcome ;)  OMG. Fizzics. I love this game. It's my total fave. ","Ricky"
"FIZZICSINTRO_INTRO","Oh, hey Riley! This is Riley, one of our students. Riley is most definitely that person you need to know here! I'm sure you two will be pals.
Take as long as you want to just play around. Try out different strategies. See what's possible! 
We'll meet back at the Clubhouse.","Ada"
"FIZZICS1_QUESTION","Hey! So I prepared this special challenge just for you in the Fizzics game. Think you can beat it?","Ricky"
"FIZZICS1_RESPONSE","Bring it on!",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCH","All right. Let's try it. Launch the Fizzics game to get started.",""
"FIZZICS1_LAUNCHHINT","See the Fizzics app on the desktop? Click it to launch. ","Played 20 seconds after quest start if they haven't launched it yet."
"FIZZICS1_GOAL","Okay. Cool. Here we are. See those 20 red balls? Your goal is to make it so they're not touching each other.",""
"FIZZICS1_EXPLANATION","OK, psych! Just wanted to see if you were paying attention. It's actually impossible to do it that way! You're gonna need to get in there and hack the game in order to get it to do what you want. 
First you're gonna need this key. It'll get you into the Level 1 Hacking Panel. And from there, there are loads of cool things you can do. ",""
"FIZZICS1_HINT","The red balls are constantly touching each other.  Think about it. What if they were smaller?  Try to get them not to touch.",""
"FIZZICS1_NOTENOUGH","Hey, wait! Nice try, but you need to keep at least 20 red balls, otherwise it doesn't count.",""
"FIZZICS1_SUCCESS","Brilliant! I knew you'd ace that. Fun, isn't it?
Wait, what?   This key just appears out of nowhere?
Whoa, check this out! This key gets us into the Level 1 Hacking Panel of the OS!! Here, I'm entrusting this to you. Keep it very safe and don't let anyone see it. ",""
"FIZZICS1_GOODBYE","See you at the Clubhouse!",""
"FIZZICS1_ABORT","Sure, let's play this again some other time! Come get me at the Clubhouse whenever you want to hang out.",""
"OSINTRO_QUESTION","The OS is a super important place. OS stands for Operating System. Would you like to see it now?","Ada"
"OSINTRO_RESPONSE","Absolutely!","Simple version for now. Later we can detect whether they tried to flip it or not and have alternate paths for the Archivist intro."
"OSINTRO_LAUNCH","Okay, so now you'll see an icon for the OS on the desktop. Go ahead and launch it.",""
"OSINTRO_EXPLANATION","The OS keeps everything running smoothly. When you're poking around back here you have to be very careful. But it's really cool to be able to adjust things and get involved in how your computer works. ",""
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST","What's all this ruckus? Oh, it's you, Ada. Finding anything interesting while you're here? And who's this with you? ","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_INTRO","Hello Dr. Rowe. This is our new student. This is Saniel, the Archivist. He keeps things in order around here. He's kind of scary at first, but no one knows more about the OS than Saniel. Also,I'll tell you more sometime, but Saniel a quite the hero!","Ada"
"OSINTRO_ARCHIVIST2","Hero Schmero. Hmmmmph. Well, anyway, hello there & welcome! Ada is one of our most brilliant students, but I'm afraid she's filing your head with ancient history! But yes, I've been around a while and I do know how things work around here. Glad Ada could show you areound, but you should never come here on your own. You never know what might happen! The only time I should ever see you here is if you're accompanied by an adult.","Archivist"
"OSINTRO_WRAPUP","See what I mean, he's a bit fierce! But so glad you could meet him. Okay, I'm gonna bounce now! Just come get me at the Clubhouse if you want to look around some more. ","Ada"
"BREAK_QUESTION","Psssst! I was hoping I'd see you. Wanna go scope around in the OS with that key we found?","Ricky"
"BREAK_RESPONSE","Definitely. ",""
"BREAK_LAUNCH","Ok. So you just need to launch the OS app now and we're golden. ",""
"BREAK_OSAPP","Awesome. This place is LIT. Okay we have to be extremely quiet. We don't want Saniel knowing we're here. He seems to be able to hear everything that goes on here. I sometimes think OS stands for Old Saniel. Wait, ssshhhh. I think I hear him. 
Ok, remember the Flip to Hack button? Now press it. ",""
"BREAK_UNLOCK","Perfect. Now click on that to unlock it. I wonder what's behind it?",""
"BREAK_UNLOCKED","Rad! All those settings. We can have so much fun with those.  
See this one. It changes the cursor size. If we slide it this way we can make it HUUUUUGE! So hilarious!",""
"BREAK_SUCCESS","OMG we have to stop laughing or San's going to hear us. Uh-oh. What happened? It's not working. What's that noise?
Oh, hi Dr. Rowe. We're just doing some studying!",""
"BREAK_ARCHIVISTARRIVES","I just told you this is no place for novices! Do you realize what you could do if you pressed the wrong buttons? 
I can't blame you though. I know you want to learn how it all works. Ada's been giving me such glowing reports about you so I'm going to let it pass this time. 
It's not too late to fix this. You can still press the reset button and it returns you to the original settings. ","Archivist"
"BREAK_WRAPUP","Good job restoring the settings! Glad you know about the reset button now. Keep it handy for when you need to clean up messes like this one! ",""
"FIZZICS2_QUESTION","I'll give you a key I found if you beat a Fizzics challenge I prepared for you.",""
"FIZZICS2_RESPONSE","Thanks! ",""
"FIZZICS2_LAUNCH","Good. Launch the Hacky Balls app. Your goal is to make it so 10 green balls are touching a single red ball at once.",""
"FIZZICS2_GOAL","This time I prepared something a little bit more challenging for you. But I know you can do it!
See those 10 green balls? You need to make sure they're touching that red ball at the same time.",""
"FIZZICS2_NOTENOUGH","You need to have at least 10 green balls and exactly 1 red ball.",""
"FIZZICS2_SUCCESS","Yay! That's a really cool solution. You've got a talent for this! I didn't think of that one.
Here's the key I found. I think it must have fallen out of Saniel's pocket. ",""
"FIZZICS2_ABORT","No prob. We can try it some other time.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT1","Start by launching the Fizzics app on the desktop.",""
"FIZZICS2_HINT2","Looks like stacking them up isn't going to work. Try going back in and hacking the app and changing the forces between ball types.",""
"HACKDEX1_QUESTION","Well Hello there. Something very peculiar seems to be happening with the roster. Can you help me with it?","Archivist"
"HACKDEX1_RESPONSE","Sure. ",""
"HACKDEX1_LAUNCH","My Roster is behaving strangely. I think something has gotten in there and corrupted it. Check to see if yours is okay. Okay. So let's see how this goes. Launch the Hackdex app.",""
"HACKDEX1_GOAL","Curses! Yours too! That's very strange. I wonder what's causing this. 
Your goal is to fix it so everything is readable again. You need the key to get to level one, but I seem to have misplaced it.",""
"HACKDEX1_SUCCESS","Ah, that's better. Your solution is acceptable.
You can take a break now. Here's the level 2 key for Fizzics. You may find it quite interesting. See you at the Clubhouse.",""
"HACKDEX1_RICKY","That was cool how you did that. Wait a sec, what's this?
What was this doing in the Roster? Or did the Archivist drop it again? Weird. Keep it anyway. I'm sure we can make good use of it.
Ok, it's been fun to explore things with you! Hope you'll come back ;) ","Ricky"
"NOQUEST_ADA_RICKY","I think Riley was looking for you earlier.","These are the comments characters make when they don't have a quest to give you. For now they just tell you to go talk to another character (if there is one)."
"NOQUEST_ADA_ARCHIVIST","Dr. Rowe wants to talk to you.",""
"NOQUEST_ADA_NOTHING","Are you enjoying yourself?",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ADA","Hey, I think Ada wants to tell you something.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_ARCHIVIST","Psss... The Archivist is looking for you.",""
"NOQUEST_RICKY_NOTHING","What are you up to?",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_ADA","Perhaps you should inquire with Ada.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_RICKY","That friend of yours is probably up to no good.",""
"NOQUEST_ARCHIVIST_NOTHING","Stay out of trouble!",""
