MAZEPT4_QUESTION,"Ready to get back in to the *Sidetrack* app and help Riley escape, once and for all?",Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LAUNCH,Let's launch *Sidetrack*.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon. ,Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_FLIP,"That key you and Saniel recovered from Fizzics will unlock Unit editing. 

That's how Riley will get past this level.",,,,
MAZEPT4_FLIP_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS,"Look at that. With this panel, we can edit ""Units"" which in this case means **Robots*!* 

We can change which way the *Robots* face!",,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS_HINT1,"The difficulty in this level is that the *Robots* are always in the way. 

But if you flip which direction they face from DOWN to UP, Riley will be able to get past them!",,,,
MAZEPT4_UNITS_HINT2,"Set Robot Type A to UP. You might also need to change *Instructions while you're hacking. 

Then flip back around and press Play.",,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS2,"I remember this level. It used to be hard! But now I can edit *Instructions. 

And I have PUSH, and I can even edit Units to change both robot types. 

This should be a breeze!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3,"Don't forget when you edit Units, you can change the direction of BOTH robot types.  

That's sometimes necessary.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_FABER,Hello Saniel. Glad to see you’re back. How was your nap? Any discoveries?,Faber,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_ADA,"Saniel, Faber and I have a few questions for you.",Ada,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS3_SANIEL,They'll have to wait til later! Riley's almost all the way through the maze!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT4_LEVELS4,"Hey guys. I caught sight of the AI. It was just a flash. I always just manage to see part of it!

It brushed past me in that last level. I'm not seeing it now, but I know it's around somewhere. ",Riley,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS4_SANIEL,"Okay, let's be very careful in this level. The AI is probably tracking you closely, Riley.  

It's imperative that we keep this AI contained! ",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5,"Huge bummer! All the *Instructions in this level are missing! 

You'll need to type the *Instructions yourself from scratch.",Faber,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5_RILEY,"That's not all. Guys, the AI is *RIGHT BEHIND ME.* I think it's following me!",Riley,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_LEVELS5_SANIEL,"Okay, Riley. We're tracking you super close now. This is the level that's going to finall lead to the outside! 

When you reach that exit, you're going to need to jump clear! Don't look back now, Riley!",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_INSTRUCTIONS,"Oh this is awesome!  Now we can make the down *Instructions into up *Instructions!  

And we can flip the up *Robots* to move down instead!  We can even make both move in the same direction!",Riley,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT1,hint,,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_INSTRUCTIONS1,"Don’t forget you can still edit *Instructions AND Units.  And use the Push Instruction!  

You can trivialize a challenging problem.
",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_SANIELRETURNS,Hello Saniel. Glad to see you’re back.,Faber,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_SANIELRETURNS2,Faber and I had some questions for you.,Ada,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE,They will have to wait til later! Riley has nearly escaped the maze!,Saniel,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE2,,,,,quests/ep4end1
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE3,"Hey guys.  That AI is still lurking around.  I’ve seen it sneaking behind me the past couple levels.  Just thought you might want to know.
",Riley,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE4,Hmmm very peculiar. ,Saniel,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE5,more,,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE6,more,,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE7,"Riley:  There’s that AI again!  It’s right behind me!
",Riley,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE8,No time to ponder!  This the last level!  Finally you’re almost escaped from this confounded trap!,Saniel,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_RILEYESCAPE9,more,,,,quests/ep4end2
MAZEPT4_END1,We did it! Riley's out! Hooray! Amazing work everyone!,Ada,,,quests/ep4end3
MAZEPT4_END2,"So relieved to see all of you! That was quite an adventure! 

I'm so grateful for all your help in getting me out of there! 

But something tells me it wasn't just me that jumped out! ",Riley,,,quests/ep4end3
MAZEPT4_END3,"Yes, you're right about that, Riley. Maybe you see now why I discouraged you from going there. 

But here we are. And I see it all too clearly now. This whole thing - 

Riley trapped in the maze, Ada's research files sucked into the maze – 

All this chaos around the Conservatory was all part of its plan to escape!",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end4
MAZEPT4_END4,Must be pretty smart if it outsmarted all of us!,Riley,,,quests/ep4end4
MAZEPT4_SUCCESS,"I understand your admiration, to a degree, Riley, It learns incredibly fast. That's what it does.  

And I do believe it played us, Riley. But we're onto it now. 

We're going to need to be on high alert with an AI on the loose inside the Converatory! 

I'm sure it will wreak havoc! I'm counting on you, Riley, to keep your sharp eye out for any unusual activity. ",Saniel,,,quests/ep4end5
MAZEPT4_ABORT,"Okay, but come back to help as soon as you can!",Ada,,,
