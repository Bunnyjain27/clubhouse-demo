Not that we'd ever use it for real or anything!",Riley,,,quests/quest2-faber-conga-build
STEALTHDEVICE_EXPLANATION,"Oh, yeah, the stealth device. Hmmm. These are very tricky, but I have studied them quite extensively. 

Pretty sure I can make one for you. For expermentation only! 

Riley, my friend, promise me, you're not going get in any kind of trouble with it, are you?",,,,quests/quest2-faber-werks

STEALTHDEVICE_EXPLANATION2,"OK, just making sure. I'll have to get my hands on a few necessary components.

I'm going to need you two to get me a click spring, a hush gasket, and a ratchet wheel the size of a penny. 

Oh, right, and some soap bubbles and a small quantity of cloaking glaze. Think you can find those things?",,,,quests/quest2-faber-werks
