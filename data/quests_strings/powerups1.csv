POWERUPS1_QUESTION,Let's do something different in Lightspeed.,Ada,,,
POWERUPS1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure thing!,,,,
POWERUPS1_LAUNCH,"Fantastic, so let's get Lightspeed fired up.",,,,
POWERUPS1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go ahead and launch Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPS1_EXPLAIN,"Now that you've played around with changing the features of the enemies, let's try something new.

We're going to make some power ups! Power ups are capsules that bring benefits when the player's ship picks them up.

Let's go to the coding panel. ",,,,
POWERUPS1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP,"Click on the PowerUp1 entity. See that handle_powerup() function? That gets called when the ship picks it up.

Let's keep this one simple. We want the ship to be invulnerable for 150 ticks whenever we pick it up.",,,,
POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP_HINT1,There's a variable in the player ship called InvulnerabilityTimer.,,,,
POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP_HINT2,You can set it like this ship.invulnerabilityTimer = X . Make X the number of ticks you want. ,,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN,"Perfect. Now let's try it. Go to level 9 and find the spawn_powerup() function.

We want to create one of these power ups every 10 seconds, so that's every 300 ticks.",,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN_HINT1,"To create a powerup, just return POWERUP0;",,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN_HINT2,"And to set it for every 300 ticks, check the tick_count and mod it with 300 just like we did before with enemies.",,,,
POWERUPS1_SUCCESS,Great. Now let's play the level and see if it's all working the way we want it to work. ,,,,
POWERUPS1_END,Fabulous! Come get me whenever you want to dream up a more interesting power up.,,,,
POWERUPS1_ABORT,Abort,,,,
