HTMLINTRO4_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn the basics of CSS, the ""secret sauce"" that makes styling web pages a snap! (Part 4)",,,,
HTMLINTRO4_1,Good to see you! I hope you're ready to learn some of the *inner secrets* of HTML ^_^,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_2,"Well, here it is - there's a way to automate all those `color=` and `font-size=` bits you've been typing out one at a time.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_3,It's called CSS - that stands for *cascading style sheets* - and it's pretty awesome. Let's get rolling.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_4,"As always - if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening your browser.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_5,Or you can click the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/vYYyNba?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_6,"You should notice a brand-new tag inside the `<head>` tag, `<style>`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_7,"Remember how to change text colors? You modified a `p` or `h1` tag with `style=""color:green""`.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_8,"The `<style>` tag lets you centralize all that manual work, by creating a set of rules that can apply to all the tags in your webpage.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_9,"Adding rules to the `<style>` tags tells the browser ""when you see this tag, apply these changes to it.""",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_10,"Let's give it a shot. To start, let's make the first paragraph purple. Between `<style>` and `</style>`, type `p { color:purple; }`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_11,"That's telling the browser ""every time you see the `<p>` tag, add `color=""purple""` to it.""",,,,
HTMLINTRO4_12,"At this point, you should have `<style> p { color:purple; } </style` (but on 3 separate lines)",,,,
HTMLINTRO4_13,"That's pretty stylish! Now that we've got some kickin' purple text, let's make it bigger.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_14,"Add `font-size: x-large;` right after the color rule, keeping it inside the braces ( *{ }* ) Don't forget a space between the rules, or the semicolon (*;*) after each one.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_15,Your `<style>` tag should now have `p { color:purple; font-size: x-large; }` inside it.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_16,Check out that text! Now *that's* got my attention.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_17,"You can style other tags like this, too. Use the name of the tag, an open brace ( *{* ), your styling, and then a closing brace ( *}* ).",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_18,Let's try making your `h1` text red. ,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_19,"To do that, you'd put `h1 { color:red; }` on the line below your instructions for `p`.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_20,"Great job! Do you see how easy this can be, now?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_21,"It doesn't matter how much text or how many tags you have in that page, the `<style>` tag will apply to all of it.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_22,"There's still another level beyond this, though - What if I told you that you could make up your own tags?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_END,Come find me in the Clubhouse soon if you want to learn it!,riley,,,
