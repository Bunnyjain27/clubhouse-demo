HTMLINTRO4_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn the basics of CSS, the ""secret sauce"" that makes styling web pages a snap! (Part 4)",,,,
HTMLINTRO4_1,I see my mention of a secret trick got you back here ^_^,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_2,"Well, here it is - there's a way to automate all those ""color="" and ""font-size="" bits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_3,"It's called CSS, and it's pretty awesome. Let's get rolling.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_4,"As always - if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening Chrome...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_5,Or clicking the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/vYYyNba?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_6,You should notice a new section inside the `<head>` tag - `<style>`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_7,"Remember how we changed text colors, before? We used `style=""color:green""` inside a tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_8,"The `<style>` tag takes all that manual work and centralizes it, like creating a set of rules.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_9,"Changing things inside the `<style>` tags tells the browser ""when you see this tag, apply these changes to it.""",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_10,"Let's give it a shot, and make the first paragraph purple. Inside the `<style>` tag, type `p { color:purple; }`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_11,"Stylish! Now that we've got some kickin' purple text, let's make it bigger.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_12,"Add `font-size: x-large;` right after the color instruction. Don't forget a space between the instructions, or the semicolon (;) after each one.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_13,That should read `p { color:purple; font-size: x-large; }`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_14,Nice. Now *that's* got my attention.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_15,"You can do this for other tags, too - Use the name of the tag, an open brace ({), your styling, and then a closing brace (}).",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_16,Let's try making your `h1` text red. ,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_17,"To do that, you'd type  `h1 { color:red; }`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_18,"Great job! So, do you see how easy this can be, now?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_19,It doesn't matter if you have an entire novel in that web page - it'll all be exactly as you say in the `<style>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_20,"There's still another level to climb to, though - What if I told you that you could make up your own tags?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO4_END,Come back soon if you want to learn it!,riley,,,
