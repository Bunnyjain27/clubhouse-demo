OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_NAME,The Command-line - Cat and Mouse,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start learning about the command-line, the most powerful tool on any computer. (Part 1 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey *{{user_name}}*! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's *supposed* to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like *this*, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,"Text `like this` is a command - something you could type into the terminal. Pay close attention to spelling, captialization, and spacing, the Terminal is *very* picky.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,"Also, pay attention to the results of what you type - If there's an error, you probably mistyped something.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt*. It tells you a lot of info, but the important part is that the part after the colon (:) tells you where you are in the filesystem.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,"Right now, that should show `~` (tilde), which means we're in your `home` directory, where all your files are.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"BTW, a *file system* is like a big group of folders, and some of them contain more folders inside them, and so on.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"To see what's around you in the current folder, you use the command `ls`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,`ls` is a command that *lists* everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"Type `ls` (lower-case L, lower-case S) into the Terminal, then hit *Enter*.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,"Running `ls` should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,"Whenever you see a new, empty prompt, the Terminal is ready for another command. It's *super* fast!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"If you had already saved any files in your home directory, you might see them in the results of that `ls`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Hmm, did you create a directory named *yarnbasket*? That sounds like something a cat would do. Let's check it out!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"To go into another folder, you use the `cd` command. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"`cd` stands for *change directory* (directory is another word for folder). Unlike `ls`, `cd` needs some information after it to tell it which directory you want to change to.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,"Since we want to go into *yarnbasket*, type `cd yarnbasket`, then hit *enter*",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,"Your prompt should now say `yarnbasket`, since you typed in `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Now that you're inside this folder, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Huh. That's a lot of yarn. Well, I guess we're going to have to investigate it!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,Let's enter the directory `redyarn` - remember how we just got in here?,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_25,"`cd redyarn` will get us where we want to go. Now, let's `ls` to look around.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_26,"Nothing here. Oh well. To get back out, we need to use a special version of `cd`, written as `cd ..`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_27,"That's `cd (space) *period period*`  - It means ""go up one level"", which will take us back to `yarnbasket`, in this case.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"OK, here we are again. If you entered `cd ..` here, where do you think we'd go? Try it, and don't forget to `ls` after.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"Hey, look, we should be back in your home directory. Use `ls` to check, if you didn't already.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,"Let's get back to `yarnbasket`, so type `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,"And now `ls` again, so we can see all the other folders we need to check.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,Let's try `greenyarn`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"That's `cd greenyarn`, then `ls`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_34,"Nothing again! Why is this called ""yarnbasket"" if there's no yarn? Let's go back.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_35,"`cd ..` takes us back, and now `ls` to check what's here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_36,One folder left to check. Take us into `blueyarn`!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_37,And let's see what we've got! (`ls`),riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_38,"Aha! A mouse! No wonder there was no yarn, this mouse ate it all!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_39,"Fortunately, I have a perfect solution. Felix! Come take care of this mouse!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_40,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&^w!_",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_41,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_42,"I love that cat, but he drives me nuts sometimes. He never does anything when you need him to!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_43,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different ""cat"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_44,"The program `cat` helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_45,"You can use `cat` on any file - just type `cat filename` - but only text files will show you anything you can read. If you forget to type a filename after `cat`, you can use *Ctrl-C* to get back to the prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_46,"OK, let's check out that file - type `cat mouse` to `cat` the file named *mouse*.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_47,LOL! Looks like Felix is playing pranks on us.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_48,"It says the mouse got away, huh? To ""greener pastures"". Maybe that's a clue to the color of the yarn he's hiding in!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_49,"Let's get out of here and find that mouse! Remember, use `cd ..` to get out of a folder.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_50,"Now, back into `greenyarn`, and `ls` to see if that mouse is hiding there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_51,Ha! Let's `cat` that file and see if we got him!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_52,"Not again! This is a clever mouse, but he's running out of places to hide. Quick, back into `yarnbasket` and then into `redyarn`!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_53,"Ok, now that we're in `redyarn`, let's `ls` and see what's hiding in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_54,Now we've got him! Let's `cat` that file!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_55,"Gotcha! But he is awfully cute, I suppose. We'll let him go today. After all, he isn't doing anything bad, really.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_56,"That was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_57,Catch you later!,riley,,,
