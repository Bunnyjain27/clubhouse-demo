OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_NAME,The Command-line - Cat and Mouse,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start learning about the command-line, the most powerful tool on any computer. (Part 1 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the <b>Terminal</b>!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's <b>supposed</b> to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the <b>real</b> stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like <b>this</b>, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,"Text <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">like this</span></tt> is a command - something you could type into the terminal. Pay close attention to spelling, captialization, and spacing, the Terminal is <b>very</b> picky.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,"Also, pay attention to the results of what you type - If there's an error, you probably mistyped something.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the <b>prompt</b>. It tells you a lot of info, but the important part is that the part after the colon (:) tells you where you are in the filesystem.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,"Right now, that should show <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">~</span></tt> (tilde), which means we're in your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">home</span></tt> directory, where all your files are.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"BTW, a <b>file system</b> is like a big group of folders, and some of them contain more folders inside them, and so on.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"To see what's around you in the current folder, you use the command <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> is a command that <b>lists</b> everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> (lower-case L, lower-case S) into the Terminal, then hit <b>Enter</b>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,"Running <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,"Whenever you see a new, empty prompt, the Terminal is ready for another command. It's <b>super</b> fast!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"If you had already saved any files in your home directory, you might see them in the results of that <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,"Hmm, did you create a directory named <b>yarnbasket</b>? That sounds like something a cat would do. Let's check it out!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"To go into another folder, you use the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> command. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> stands for <b>change directory</b> (directory is another word for folder). Unlike <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt> needs some information after it to tell it which directory you want to change to.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,"Since we want to go into <b>yarnbasket</b>, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>, then hit <b>enter</b>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,"Your prompt should now say <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, since you typed in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Now that you're inside this folder, type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Huh. That's a lot of yarn. Well, I guess we're going to have to investigate it!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,"Let's enter the directory <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt> - remember how we just got in here?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_25,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd redyarn</span></tt> will get us where we want to go. Now, let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to look around.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_26,"Nothing here. Oh well. To get back out, we need to use a special version of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd</span></tt>, written as <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_27,"That's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd (space) <b>period period</b></span></tt>  - It means ""go up one level"", which will take us back to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, in this case.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"OK, here we are again. If you entered <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> here, where do you think we'd go? Try it, and don't forget to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> after.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"Hey, look, we should be back in your home directory. Use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to check, if you didn't already.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,"Let's get back to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>, so type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,"And now <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> again, so we can see all the other folders we need to check.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,"Let's try <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">greenyarn</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"That's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd greenyarn</span></tt>, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_34,"Nothing again! Why is this called ""yarnbasket"" if there's no yarn? Let's go back.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_35,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> takes us back, and now <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to check what's here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_36,"One folder left to check. Take us into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">blueyarn</span></tt>!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_37,"And let's see what we've got! (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt>)",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_38,"Aha! A mouse! No wonder there was no yarn, this mouse ate it all!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_39,"Fortunately, I have a perfect solution. Felix! Come take care of this mouse!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_40,"<i>Nyan, brrrp? Miao&^w!</i>",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_41,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.&gt;</span></tt>",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_42,"I love that cat, but he drives me nuts sometimes. He never does anything when you need him to!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_43,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different ""cat"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_44,"The program <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_45,"You can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> on any file - just type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat filename</span></tt> - but only text files will show you anything you can read. If you forget to type a filename after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt>, you can use <b>Ctrl-C</b> to get back to the prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_46,"OK, let's check out that file - type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat mouse</span></tt> to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> the file named <b>mouse</b>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_47,LOL! Looks like Felix is playing pranks on us.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_48,"It says the mouse got away, huh? To ""greener pastures"". Maybe that's a clue to the color of the yarn he's hiding in!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_49,"Let's get out of here and find that mouse! Remember, use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd ..</span></tt> to get out of a folder.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_50,"Now, back into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">greenyarn</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to see if that mouse is hiding there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_51,"Ha! Let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> that file and see if we got him!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_52,"Not again! This is a clever mouse, but he's running out of places to hide. Quick, back into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt> and then into <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt>!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_53,"Ok, now that we're in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">redyarn</span></tt>, let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> and see what's hiding in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_54,"Now we've got him! Let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> that file!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_55,"Gotcha! But he is awfully cute, I suppose. We'll let him go today. After all, he isn't doing anything bad, really.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_56,"That was fun! You learned <b>ls</b>, <b>cd</b>, and <b>cat</b> - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_57,Catch you later!,riley,,,
