HTMLINTRO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Learn the basics of web pages and the language they're written in  - HTML. (Part 1),,,,
HTMLINTRO1_1,"Hi, *{{user_name}}*! I know you've used the internet before - but have you ever wondered what goes into showing you all those web pages?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_2,"I was wondering that, one day, and I decided to go find out. There was a ton to learn, but now that I've done the legwork, I can pass it on to you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_3,"Before I explain anything, let's get you looking at the guts of a web page.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_4,"The page should open for you, but if it doesn't, you can try running Chrome...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_5,...Or you can click this link: https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/BaaNeXj?editors=1000#code-area,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_6,OK! Here we are. One half of your browser is showing you the code that the page is written in...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_7,...And the other half is what you'd see if you found this page on the internet.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_8,"If you want to see things side-by-side, you can click the *Change View* button in the upper right, and change the *Editor Layout* to a different one.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_9,"You might need to resize Chrome's window to find that button, so just click the arrows between the minimize button and the X to let you do that.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_10,"Just like computer programs, web pages are written in a kind of code - It's called HTML.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_11,"You put HTML around text, and that tells your web browser what to show, and how to show it on your screen. Not so bad, right?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_12,"In HTML, everything with *<* and *>* around it is called a *tag*. Tags tell the browser how to display something - text, images, whatever.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_13,"Tags usually come in pairs - an *<opening tag>*, and a *</closing tag>*, like saying *start* and *stop*",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_14,"Let's get our hands dirty! Find the text *Hello, World!* on the page, and change it. Add your name, your favorite food, whatever you like.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_15,"Awesome! You just edited a webpage, so that makes you a web designer!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_16,Let's take it one step further - see the *<h1>* tags in the code? Try changing the text between them...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO1_END,"Nice job! HTML isn't as confusing as it looks, right?. Come back to continue the adventure, and we'll go deeper!",riley,,,
