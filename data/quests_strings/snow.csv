SNOW_QUEST_NAME,Let it snow!,,,,
SNOW_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
SNOW_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"This is OS hacking at it's finest. Spectacular effects for your desktop. Learn about GNOME Shell extensions, CSS and emojis.",,,,
SNOW_ABORT,"It's alright, we can try this later.",riley,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION0,"As you all know I have a passion for art. For as long as there has been art, artists have been enthused by nature. I am fascinated by the beauty of snow crystals. And today I would like to bring that beauty to your computing environment. ",estelle,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION1,Thank you Estelle for that lovely introduction. As we say around here: Let the snow begin!,faber,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION2,"So for the next experiment we need to modify our Operating System, the Graphical user interface to it to be more precise. We can do this by adding so called <b>Shell extensions</b>, tiny programs that add something special to your Desktop. There are lots of different extensions that you can explore here: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://extensions.gnome.org/</span></u>

Riley will walk you though the setup process. We had hacking the OS in class just recently.",saniel,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION3,"Ok, Saniel. Fortunately, I already have the <b>Snow</b> extension here, so I can just install it for you. ",riley,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION4,"<b>{{user_name}}</b> please press ""Install"" on the dialog that pops up, and we can continue.",riley,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION_ERROR,"Uh-oh, looks like something's gone wrong with the extension install! We can't keep going without that, so I have to end this activity. Sorry!",daemon,,,
SNOW_EXTENSION_APP1,"Now that the <b>Snow</b> extension is installed, we need to enable it. To do so, we need to install a little app that lets you manage extensions.",riley,,,
SNOW_ENABLE1,"Every extension that you have installed can be either <b>enabled</b> or <b>disabled</b>. So next we need to enable the <b>Snow</b> extension. Check the <b>Desktop</b> for the <b>Extensions</b> app, and launch it.",riley,,,
SNOW_ENABLE2,This application shows all your extensions  - you can enable or disable each one using the switch on the <b>right</b>.,riley,,,
SNOW_ENABLE3,"Look for the <b>Snow</b> extension, and click the switch to the <b>right</b> of it to enable it.",riley,,,
SNOW_ENABLE4,"Conglatulations, you enabled the extension! Now look at the panel and you should see the ‚ùÑÔ∏è icon. That's the <b>Snow</b> extension!",riley,hurray,,
SNOW_ENABLE5,"Click the ‚ùÑÔ∏è, and then click the <b>Let it snow!</b> button to turn the snow on. If you want to turn it off, just click the <b>Let it snow!</b> button again.",riley,,,
SNOW_ENABLE6,Wow this is so beautiful!,estelle,,,
SNOW_TOOLBOX1,"OK, now that we enjoyed that, how about <b>hacking</b> the extension? Go back to the <b>Extensions</b> app.",saniel,,,
SNOW_TOOLBOX2,"Saniel, you are sweat, let the kid enjoy the beauty of the moment.",ada,,,
SNOW_TOOLBOX3,"Sorry, didn't mean to rush. Just keep on whenever you are.",saniel,,,
SNOW_TOOLBOX4,"Do you see the button on the left side of the <b>Extensions</b> app? If you click on it, you can <b>flip</b> the <b>Extensions</b> app and <b>hack</b> it!",riley,,,
SNOW_TOOLBOX3,"Great! Here's the <b>tooblox</b> of the Extensions app. Play around with the controls to change how the snow falls. Try changing the snowflakes to ""üò∫Ô∏è"", and make it snow cats!",riley,,,
SNOW_UNICODE1,"You can also change the actual <b>code</b> in the <b>Toolbox</b>. I think you've already figured out that this extension uses <b>emoji</b> for its snowflakes - but did you know you can also use a <b>list</b> of emoji for the snowflakes, not just a single one?",riley,,,
SNOW_UNICODE2,"There's a list of emoji at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://emojipedia.org/</span></u> Using that website, you can look for any emoji and copy with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">c</span></tt>, then paste it into the <b>code</b> with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">v</span></tt>.",riley,,,
SNOW_UNICODE3,"There's an easier way to look for an emoji on some modern systems - Try clicking in the text editor, then pressing <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl</span></tt> + <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">.</span></tt> - On most GNOME systems, that should show the emoji picker.",riley,,,
SNOW_UNICODE4,"Try using this list of emoji in the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">myFlakes</span></tt> variable - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">[""üèÄÔ∏è"", ""‚öæÔ∏è"", ""‚öΩÔ∏è"", ""üèàÔ∏è""]</span></tt>. The complete line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">myFlakes = [""üèÄÔ∏è"", ""‚öæÔ∏è"", ""‚öΩÔ∏è"", ""üèàÔ∏è""];</span></tt>.",riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES1,There's yet <b>another</b> way that you can modify the <b>snow</b>! Click the <b>Styles</b> tab on the <b>left side</b> of the <b>Toolbox</b>!,riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES2,"The snow is defined using <b>CSS</b>, just like you've used on webpages in other activities. If you haven't seen <b>CSS</b> yet, you can try out some of the activities in the <b>Web Pathway</b> and see what it's all about. For the snow, though, you don't really need to know much.",riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES3,"Look at the code, here - there's a <b>snowflake</b> class that defines all snowflakes, and then we have 3 more classes that are randomly assigned to every snowflake - <b>snowflake1</b>, <b>snowflake2</b> and <b>snowflake3</b>",riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES4,"Those three classses each modify a snowflake in a different way - that's why some snowflakes are bigger than others. Try changing the number after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">font-size</span></tt>, and then click on the <b>Let it snow!</b> button to see the result of your changes!",riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES5,"You can also play with colors. If you look in the <b>snowflake</b> class, you can see that there's a color set for all the snowflakes.",riley,,,
SNOW_STYLES6,"To change the color of one of the larger or smaller snowflakes, copy the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">color</span></tt> line from <b>snowflake</b> into <b>snowflake1</b>. Then you can change the color to something else. If you don't have any ideas, give red (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">#f00</span></tt>) a shot!",riley,,,
SNOW_END,"Shell extensions sure are cool, huh? They're powerful ... but that means you have to be careful which ones you install, because they could really mess up your system. Be careful, but have fun!",riley,,,
