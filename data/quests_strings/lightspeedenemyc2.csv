LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUESTION,Hey! Want to make that new Lightspeed enemy be smarter?,Riley,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH,"OK, guess which app to launch.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Lightspeed! Doh!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_EXPLAIN,"All right. So right now this new enemy moves mindlessly like the other enemies. That's not very scary.

We want it to move TOWARDS the player! Let's flip to hack and write some code.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE,"In the updateBeam() function, we can change the enemy's vertical position by controlling the y coordinate.

But instead of moving in a fixed pattern, we should make it move up if the player is higher, and down if the player is lower.

The player's ship vertical position is stored in playerShipPositionY. Compare it to the enemy y and increase it or decrease it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT1,First you should check if the player ship is higher or lower. if (playerShipPositionY > enemy.pos.y) means the player is higher.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT2,"In that case, you can increase the enemy position: enemy.pos.y += 1;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT3,"If it's lower, we can use the else keyword (if (...) { } else { }",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT4,"And in that case, we can lower the enemy: enemy.pos.y -= 1;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_PLAYTEST,Move the ship up and down in front of the enemies to see if they track us...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOENEMIES,Weird. I don't see any enemies anymore. Did you change something? Let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_NOTMOVING,It's not moving at all. Something must be wrong. Let's check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_SUCCESS,That's what I'm talking about! Look how this enemy chases us! It's a lot harder now! Very cool.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
