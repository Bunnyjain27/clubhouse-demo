POWERUPS2_QUESTION,Ready to make a new power up?,Ada,,,
POWERUPS2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
POWERUPS2_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPS2_EXPLAIN,You already know how to create a simple powerup. Let's go to the code for PowerUp2.,,,,
POWERUPS2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click on the Flip button and then click on the PowerUp2 entity.,,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE,"OK, we want to do an awesome powerup: Whenever it gets picked up, we want all enemies on screen to blow up at once!

All the enemies come in an array called enemies. To blow up just the first enemy, we would call BlowUp(enemies[0]); Try it.",,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2,"Right. But we want to blow them all up. We can find out how many enemies we have by doing len(enemies);

That tells us how many enemies we have in that array. So we could write that function over and over.

But that would be really boring! Let's use a loop instead. A loop lets us repeat some code a number of times.

We start the loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) {} The variable i is incremented every time through the loop.

And inside the loop we can access each enemy with enemies[i]. Blow them all up!",,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2_HINT1,Set up a loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) { ... } and then call the BlowUp() function for each enemy.,,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2_HINT2,You can write it like this: for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) { BlowUp(enemies[i]; },,,,
POWERUPS2_SPAWN,Looks good. Now we need to also spawn PowerUp2 in the spawn_powerup() function.,,,,
POWERUPS2_PLAY,Great. Let's play through the level and check it out.,,,,
POWERUPS2_SUCCESS,Yeah! That worked great. Good job! I think I have something for you.,,,,
POWERUPS2_END,Take this XXX. It just might come in handy. See you later!,,,,
POWERUPS2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
