HTMLINTRO2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Take your HTML knowledge to the next level by learning about web colors. (Part 2),,,,
HTMLINTRO2_1,"Hey again! Ready to dive a little deeper, *{{user_name}}*?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_2,First things first - let's get back to that web page previewer.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_3,"If it's not opening, run or switch to Chrome. You can hold *Alt* and press *Tab* to cycle through active programs, or look at the bottom of the screen.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_4,... Or you can click this link: https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/BaaKggj?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_5,"Here's a fun fact - Just based on our last lesson, you already know enough to make your own webpage!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_6,"If you did, though, all you'd have is boring black text on a white background. Let's spice that up a little...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_7,"Find an opening `<p>` tag in your code, and add `style=”color:blue”` after the `p`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_8,"If you did it correctly, the tag should look like this `<p style=""color:blue"">`, and your text will be blue!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_9,Congratulations! You just *styled* some text! Now let's get even fancier.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_10,Find another `<p>` tag and make *that* text orange.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_11,I wonder what happens if you try the same thing with an `<h1>` or `<h2>` tag? Try making one of those purple.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_12,"If you did it right, it should look something like `<h1 style=""color:purple"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_13,"Nice. What if you wanted to use a super-special shade of green, though? How wouod you do that?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_14,"Clearly, we need a more specific way to express color, one that gives us exact control.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_15,"Fortunately, your web browser understands something called *hex color*, which is a way of expressing color using 6-digit numbers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_16,Here's an example hex color - *#76EECF*,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_17,"Notice the letters in there - Hex color uses 1 to 9, then A B C D E F. Think of it as a way of getting numbers higher than 9, without using 2 digits.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_18,"The 3 groups of 2 numbers in a *hex color* express how much *red*, *green*, and *blue* make up that color. It's similar to how primary colors work in painting.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_19,"*#76EECF* means some red (76), *lots* of green (EE), and a good amount of blue (CF)..",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_20,"To use this hex color in your webpage, replace one of your color words with that hex code: `#76EECF`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_21,"If you edited a `<p>` tag, it would be <p style=""color:#76EECF"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_22,Cool! Change the numbers around and see if you can create another color!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_23,"If you don't want to just guess at color shades, you can try this webpage: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO2_END,"Nice job, now you've got the tools to paint the whole internet. Come find me back in the Clubhouse to keep going!",riley,,,
