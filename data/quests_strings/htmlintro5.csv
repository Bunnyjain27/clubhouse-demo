HTMLINTRO5_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to make your own HTML tags, and fully customize your webpage however you like! (Part 5)",,,,
HTMLINTRO5_1,"OK, are you ready to forge your own tags in the fires of the internet?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_2,... That sounded a little better in my head. Let's just ... move on...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_3,"As always - if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening your browser.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_4,"Or, you can click this link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/LYYxzOo?editors=1000",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_5,"So, why would you need to make your own tags? Well, what if you have 20 `<p>` tags and you want some to be red, some blue, and some green?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_6,"That's a *lot* of work, and because they're all `<p>` tags, you can't use the `<style>` tag, since that would apply to all of them.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_7,"To solve that problem, you'd need to create your own tags! It's a good thing that I can show you how to do that. ^_^",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_8,"As our first step, we need to check out `<div>` tags. The name is short for division, because they're used to divide your page up.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_9,Surround the first set of `<p>` tags in this page with a `<div>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_10,You should have an opening `<div>` tag on line 10 and the closing `</div>` tag on line 16.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_11,"Cool, now we can use that `<div>` tag to style the text. Add some color to everything in your div tag, using the `<style>` section of the page.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_12,It works just like you'd make your `<p>` or `<h1>` blue: Type `div { color:blue; }`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_13,"See? Now all the text in your `<div>` should be blue. Before we move on, let's sneak in some prep for my next trick - make that first `<div>` tag read `<div id=""first"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_14,"It looks wierd, but I'll explain in a minute, I promise.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_15,"Next, let's make another section. Add `<div id=""second"">` on line 17 and a closing `</div>` tag on line 18.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_16,"The second section of text should now be blue, too. But what was up with those `id` bits?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_17,"`id` is key for turning normal, boring `<div>` tags into unique tags. ",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_18,"Because you gave those two `<div>`s different names, you can style them individually.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_19,Change your `div` line in the `<style>` tag to `div#first` . We're going to make our `<div>`s different colors.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_20,"Then, write another line below that for the `<div>` named ""second"".",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_21,It should be `div#second { color:green; }` (or a different color if you like).,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_22,"Check out your page, the two `div`s should be different colors!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_23,"Cool, huh?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_24,"Try adding a third named `<div>` for the middle `<p>` tag, and making that text pink.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_25,"So, you would first put `<div id=""third"">` before the `<p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_26,"Next, you'd put a `</div>` after the closing `</p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_27,"Last, you'd add `div#third { color:pink; }` to the `<style>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_28,That's a pretty impressive-looking page. ^_^,riley,hurray,,
HTMLINTRO5_29,"Don't forget that you can also change the `font-size`, and everything else we've previously done to style text, too.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_30,"For example, try changing the paragraph colors to follow the rainbow - Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_31,"There are so many other things you can change about each tag, we've barely scratched the surface.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_32,Check out https://www.w3schools.com/ for *tons* more info and tutorials about HTML and CSS - It's one of the best reference sites around.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_33,"Here's where this particular adventure ends, for the moment. Thanks for sticking with me the whole way, and I hope you learned some cool tricks! See you around!",riley,hurray,,
