HTMLINTRO5_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to make your own HTML tags, and fully customize your webpage however you like! (Part 5)",,,,
HTMLINTRO5_1,"OK, are you ready to forge your own tags in the fires of the internet?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_2,... That sounded a little better in my head. Let's just ... move on...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_3,"As always - if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening Chrome...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_4,Or clicking the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/LYYxzOo?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_5,Making your own tags is one of the final pieces of making a web page display exactly how you want it to.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_6,"The tag we'll use for this is called `<div>`, short for division, because it divides your page up.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_7,Let's try it - Surround the first 3 sets of `<p>` tags in this page with a `<div>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_8,You should have an opening `<div>` tag on line 10 and the closing `</div>` tag on line 16.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_9,"Great! Now we can play with the text. Add some color to everything in your div tag, using the `<style>` section of the page.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_10,It works just like using the `<style>` section for `<p>` or `<h1>` - `div { color:blue; }`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_11,Cool! Now your `<div>` is blue. Now surround the second section of text with a `<div>` tag as well.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_12,You should have an opening `<div>` tag on line 17 and the closing `</div>` tag on line 18.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_13,"Now, you should see that the second section of text is blue too. Cool.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_14,"Now, I did promise to let you make your own tags, and we're going to use `<div>`s to do it.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_15,We need one last ingredient - `id`s!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_16,"Change your two opening div tags to read `<div id=""first"">` and `<div id=""second"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_17,"Now these two `<div>`s are different, because they have names, now!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_18,Let's give them different colors - Change your `div` line in the `<style>` tag to `div#first`...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_19,"And then write another line below that for the `<div>` named ""second"".",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_20,It should be `div#second { color:green; }` (or a different color if you like).,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_21,Now both `div`s are different colors!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_22,"Try putting in a third named `<div>` for the middle `<p>` tag, and making that text white.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_23,"Put a `<div id=""third"">` before the `<p>` tag...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_24,... put a `</div>` after the closing `</p>` tag...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_25,... and then add `div#third { color:white; }` to the `<style>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_26,"Wow! That's a pretty impressive-looking page, now.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_27,"Don't forget that you can change the `font-size`, too.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_28,There are also so many other things you can change - We barely scratched the surface.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_29,Check out https://www.w3schools.com/ for way more info on HTML and CSS - It's one of the best reference sites around.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_END,"Here's where this adventure ends, for the moment. Thanks for sticking with me the whole way - I hope you learned some cool tricks!",riley,,,
