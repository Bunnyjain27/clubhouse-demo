HTMLINTRO5_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to make your own HTML tags, and fully customize your webpage however you like! (Part 5)",,,,
HTMLINTRO5_1,"OK, are you ready to forge your own tags in the fires of the internet?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_2,... That sounded a little better in my head. Let's just ... move on...,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_3,"As always - if the previewer page doesn't open, try opening your browser.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_4,"Or, you can click this link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/LYYxzOo?editors=1000",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_5,Creating your own tags is a critical piece of making a web page that shows up exactly how you want it to.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_6,"To create our own tags, we first need to check out how `<div>` tags work. The name is short for division, because they're used to divide your page up.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_7,Surround the first set of `<p>` tags in this page with a `<div>` tag.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_8,You should have an opening `<div>` tag on line 10 and the closing `</div>` tag on line 16.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_9,"Cool, now we can use thatv `<div>` tag to style the text. Add some color to everything in your div tag, using the `<style>` section of the page.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_10,It works just like using the `<style>` section for `<p>` or `<h1>`. Type `div { color:blue; }`,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_11,"See? Now all the text in your `<div>` should be blue. Next, surround the second section of text with a `<div>` tag as well.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_12,You should have an opening `<div>` tag on line 17 and the closing `</div>` tag on line 18.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_13,"The second section of text should now be blue, too. Excellent.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_14,"So, you see how `<div>` works. It's very similar to every other tag. Now, though, we can use it create our own tags.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_15,We need one last ingredient - `id`s!,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_16,"Change your two opening div tags to read `<div id=""first"">` and `<div id=""second"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_17,"You've just made these two `<div>`s into unique tags, because you gave them each a name!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_18,Change your `div` line in the `<style>` tag to `div#first` . We're going to make them different colors.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_19,"Then, write another line below that for the `<div>` named ""second"".",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_20,It should be `div#second { color:green; }` (or a different color if you like).,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_21,"Check out your page, the two `div`s should be different colors!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_22,"Try adding a third named `<div>` for the middle `<p>` tag, and making that text white.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_23,"So, you would first put `<div id=""third"">` before the `<p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_24,"Next, you'd put a `</div>` after the closing `</p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_25,"Last, you'd add `div#third { color:white; }` to the `<style>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_26,Check it out - it's like that text is invisible now! That's a pretty impressive-looking page. ^_^,riley,hurray,,
HTMLINTRO5_27,"Don't forget that you can also change the `font-size`, and everything else we've previously done to style text, too.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_28,"There are so many other things you can change about each tag, we've barely scratched the surface.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_29,Check out https://www.w3schools.com/ for *tons* more info and tutorials about HTML and CSS - It's one of the best reference sites around.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO5_END,"Here's where this particular adventure ends, for the moment. Thanks for sticking with me the whole way, and I hope you learned some cool tricks! See you around!",riley,,,
