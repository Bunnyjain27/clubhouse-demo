MAZEPT1_QUESTION,Did you notice what just happened? Riley's box became an app called Sidetrack! Let's launch it and see what's inside!,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_QUEST_ACCEPT,You bet!,,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Go ahead and Launch Sidetrack,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA_HINT1,Click the Sidetrack icon on the desktop.,,,,
MAZEPT1_RILEYHELLO,"Oh, heyyy, wassup? But, um, srsly, YOU GUYS!!! So glad to see you! That last part was pretty bumpy!

I mean, t's actually pretty rad in here, but suddenly I'm just here in this maze 24/7. My life rn? Running. 

Looking for me? Catch me here, running! Forward, and up, forward, and down. Yep, even on the diagonal. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_EXIT,"I'm learning so much in here, but I do hope to get back to my _actual_ classes one day. 

Kind of forgot what my classes even were, it's been so intense lately. Let's see, there's Ada's class...

*Algorithmic Approaches to Machine Learning*  I'm getting lots of good ideas for that in here! LOL.   

See that Exit? That's my dream, to get to that exit. 

",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,And you can help me by getting me through these levels!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN Instructions to move me through the maze.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT3,Watch out for those walls!,,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,"Ouch! I might look virtual here in this app, but it still smarts when I bump into walls!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,Oh no! Are you kidding me? Another level! How many can there be?,,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,"This is preposterous! This maze should have only one level!

Something has been in there wreaking havoc with it!",Saniel,talk_anger,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"Is that a pit I see in the ground!  Impossible! How does a pit just suddenly open in the ground?

When I….uh, let's say, previously, in my experience with mazes of this type, you'd have only walls. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4_HINT1,Riley will have to use her JUMP Instruction to cross the pits!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,"Really? You call yourself a maze, Maze?  If that's all you've got, I'll be bouncing this ""maze"" in no time.",Riley,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FELIX,mjau ^ = ^ mjav //\\ ngiyaw /\ ^  miav,Felix,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,"Wait, listen. Did I just hear more meowing coming from in there? What is up with that? ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,Hold on. Rile? I'm not seeing your manual controls. They're gone. What is happening?,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I going to get out of this maze if I can't move!?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,This is most irregular! I'm seeing that it has given you a set of Instructions already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_HINT1,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,"It looks like you can still move, but you have to know all your moves in advance and execute the instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_HINT1,Press PLAY again to get through this new level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,"To solve this level, you'll need to decide on a strategy and reorder the Instructions accordingly.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those Instructions to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY when you’re ready.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,Well played! You ordered the Instructions so that Riley sailed right out of this level! Excellent thinking!,Saniel,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Oops, let's try that again. Make sure the Instructions are in an order that gets Riley safely to the exit.

Once you press PLAY you can no longer change the Instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY,"Excuse me. I need to tell this to someone. Long ago I created this maze! This disaster is on me, I'm afraid.  

This thing was state-of-the-art, in its time! Its purpose was to divert and exhaust rogue AIs who infiltrate the System. 

Now it's all gone terribly wrong and swallowed up our Riley! I just did not see this coming. it's been defunct for ages

I just don't see where it came back online. I've been reviewing the commit logs and something's very off. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY2,"It appears that someone – or some_thing_ – has been in here running fast and loose with levels.

From the looks of it, it's been in here for quite some time, propagating levels and making them harder! 

I told Riley time and time again not to be poking around in the Windows area, now we're really in a fix.

I will not let her down. I'm going to go solve this the fastest, surest way I know: I'm going to go take a catnap.",,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,"Um, hello? What’s THAT Instruction!? The one at position 6. Something's all WRONG with it!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY just to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try!,,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"That Instruction does some biZarre things to me! Not digging it at all. 

And I for sure can’t get through this level with that Instruction in the mix.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA2,"You’re right. I think there must be a syntax error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.

And to see the code, we’ll need the Instructions panel key. Oh boy, here we go. Saniel probably has it. ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"Hey guys! I just checked in with Saniel. He was half-asleep, but he says he knows where we can find that key.

He stashed it inside Lightspeed long ago, ""to keep it safe,"" LOL. Saniel never forgets anything!

Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go find it together.",Faber,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,Come find me later and we can keep working on this! ,Ada,,,
