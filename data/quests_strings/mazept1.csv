MAZEPT1_QUESTION,"Whoa! That whole trap jumped from the Clubhouse to the desktop! With Riley still inside it!

Hope Riley's okay in there! Now the trap is a new app called *Sidetrack*! 

So that's what the ""TRANSCODING"" was all about. Let's launch it and see what it does!

",Ada,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Ready!,,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA,Go ahead and Launch *Sidetrack*,Ada,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_LAUNCH_ADA_HINT1,Click the *Sidetrack* icon on the desktop.,,,,quests/horse-tale
MAZEPT1_RILEYHELLO,"Oh, heyyy, wassup? But, srsly, YOU GUYS!!! So glad to see you! 

Whew. That last part was pretty rough! Wasn't sure I'd make it through! 

Actually though, it's rad in here, but suddenly I'm just here in this maze 24/7. My life rn? Running. 

Looking for me? Catch me here, running! Forward, and up, forward, and down. Yep, even on the diagonal. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_EXIT,"I'm learning tons in here, but I do hope to get back to my _actual_ classes one day. 

Kind of forgot about my homework in here, but I'm hoping Ada and Estelle might understand!

Hope all this counts for some extra credit in my ""Foundations of Machine Learning"" class, LOL",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1,"See that *Exit*? That's my dream, to get to that exit. 

And you can help me by getting me through these levels!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT1,"Use the FORWARD, UP, and DOWN Instructions to move me through the maze.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT2,"I always run one space to the right, but I can also move UP or DOWN at the same time.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL1_HINT3,Watch out for those *Walls*!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_DIED_RESTART,"Ouch! I might look virtual, but it still smarts when I bump into *Walls*!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL2,"Oh no! Another level? I thought I just had to get the exit!

How many levels can there be? Okay, I'm ready for whatever's next. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL3,"This is preposterous! This maze should have only one level!

Clearly something's been wreaking havoc with it!",Saniel,talk_anger,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4,"Wait. What is that pit doing there? There were no *Pits* in there when I...

How does a pit just suddenly crack open in the ground? When I uh, 

let's say, previously, in my experience with mazes of this type, you'd have only *Walls*. ",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL4_HINT1,Riley will have to use her JUMP Instruction to cross the *Pits*!,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL5,"Are you kidding me? *Pits*? Well at least I'm a good jumper!

No doubt there's some kind of extra trick to jumping over them!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_MANUAL5_HINT1,"The JUMP Instruction only allows you to move forward. 

You can JUMP over a pit directly in front of you, but not one diagonally up or down.  

Sometimes that makes it tricky to use a JUMP!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS1,"Um, hello. What are these? *Robot* insects? OMG. Insects, really? 

What's next? Lions? Actually, that could actually be cool. I'd be so down to hang out in here with lions. 

But okay, so *Robots. LOL. Hi! My. Name. Is. Riley. What's. Your. Name.  ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS2,"Okay, Riley, very funny. Be careful though. See what you can learn about their rules. 

Maybe you can use their own rules _against_ them. 

And whatever you do, try not to wind up in the same space as them!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3,"Watch their movement carefully to understand their programming. 

That's the way to proceed safely to the exit!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3_HINT1,"These *Robots* only move DOWN, never left or right.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTS3_HINT2,"And when they walk off the bottom, it's as if they swim under the maze.

And then they reappear at the top! So keep your eye out for that!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_MOREROBOTS,"Uh oh, looks like somebody's got a robot friend. Cuuuute! 

So this new type only moves UP.  And the first one only moves DOWN. 

Okaaaay, Good to know! Must be really fun to go on a walk with them.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1,"Alright, so we've got some Robots, and we've got some *Pits*, and some *Walls*.

No prob. Saniel, my friend, I've got this. I'll be bouncing this ""maze"" in no time!",Riley,hurray,,

MAZEPT1_AUTO1_FABER,"Wait, listen. Did I just hear more meowing coming from in there? 

Did one of Saniel's cats follow Riley into the trap?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_ADA,"Sounds like it! Hold on. Riley? I'm not seeing your manual controls. 

They just totally disappeared. Do you see that? ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_RILEY,How am I going to get out of this maze if I can't move!?,Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL,This is most irregular! I'm seeing that the maze has given you a set of Instructions already.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO1_SANIEL_HINT1,See that PLAY button? Try pushing that.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2,"Good news! You can still move, but you've got a new challenge. 

Now you have to plan all your moves in advance. 

And then, after you have the Instructions lined up, you press PLAY.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO2_HINT1,Press PLAY to execute the Instructions and get through the level.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3,"I can foresee how executing this set of Instructions won't get you to the Exit in one piece.

To solve this level, you'll need to decide on a strategy and reorder the Instructions accordingly.",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT1,You’ll need to drag and drop those Instructions to put them in a new order.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_HINT2,Press PLAY when you’re ready.,Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_SUCCESS,"That's some excellent strategic thinking! 

You ordered the Instructions so that Riley sailed right out of this level! ",Saniel,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO3_FAILURE,"Good try! Let's try that again. Review the order of the Instructions. 

What order of Instructions will get Riley safely to the exit?

Once you press PLAY you can no longer change the Instructions!",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY,"This thing is really behaving strangely. I should have been able to get Riley out by now. 

",Saniel,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY2,"Saniel, we're all trying to figure this thing out. Don't be so hard on yourself.

This box has just been sitting there with a bunch of other defunct components forever.

How could you know it would suddenly light up and swallow Riley? 

You didn't know there were levels and levels of mazes in there! It's not like you built it! ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY3,I’m afraid I did. ,Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY4,"Wait. You did know about the mazes? Or do you mean you did BUILD IT?

Saniel, hold on, are you saying you built this trap?",Ada,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY5,"You built this? Saniel, but then–",Faber,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY6,"Yes. that’s exactly what I’m saying. This disaster is on me. I built this trap. And others!

It's whole purpose of this one is to deflect rogue AIs!  It lures the AI with alot of power and memory. 

And then, essentially, it just keeps AI busy doing whatever it's trained to do. 

It works by diverting and exhausting the AI, hence the name.
",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY7,"Oh, I get it, by  _Sidetrack_ing them, nice. I'm starting to understand. 

Saniel, when did you say you made this trap? 
",Ada,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY8,"Ancient history, Ada. If you're really interested, maybe I can tell you more sometime. 

Right now, I'm trying to figure out what's made this trap active again. 

I've been reviewing the commit logs and something's very off. 

It appears that someone – or some_thing_ – has been in here running fast and loose with levels.",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY9,"Looks like it's been in here for quite some time, propagating levels and making them harder! 

I told Riley time and time again not to be poking around in the Windows area. Now we're really in a fix.

I won't let her down! I'm going to go solve this the fastest, surest way I know: I'm going to go take a catnap.",Saniel,,,quests/san-backstory
MAZEPT1_AUTO4_BACKSTORY10,"I've seen that work before, Saniel!  I know you'll dream up a solution.

Hey Riley, how's it going in there? ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP,"Oh, hey Faber, you know, just chillin' in here! Any hope I might see the exit soon?

At least this next level looks familiar. Should be a snap. ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP_ADA,But look closely. You only have one JUMP. Think strategically!,Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEJUMP_ADA_HINT1,"If you only have one JUMP, then you need to use it on the only pit you can't walk around.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD,"Ugh, here I am again! At least this time, I have two JUMP Instructions.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD_ADA,"Yes, but now you only have one FORWARD Instruction! Where should it go?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_ONEFORWARD_ADA_HINT1,"There's one place in this level that you *must* move forward, not up or down. Use FORWARD there!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_SLIDING,"Oh, real nice. So many DOWN Instructions and I need to move forward! 

I wonder what happens when I use DOWN when I'm already at the bottom.

Hope I don't fall off. Maybe I'll sort of slide along the bottom edge? 

Only one way to find out!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA1,"Hey Faber, wasn't that so intense when Saniel told us about making the trap! ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_FABER1,"Yeah, I always thought there was something about him he wasn't telling us. 

But can't you totally picture him back in the day stopping rogue AIs in their tracks?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA2,"Don't you think it's strange that he's just telling us this now? 

Riley's been in this trap for a long time!",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_FABER2,"That's such a good point, Ada. Yeah, why couldn't he just, like, open it?

That's totally not like Dr. Rowe. He is usually so quick to at least offer a solution. ",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_DRAMA_ADA3,"Exactly. I have a theory I've been investigating. I've been wanting to talk to you about it. 

Something is starting to click, but I'm stil missing some key elements. ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5,"Um, hello? Guys? What’s _that_ Instruction!? The one at position 3. 

Something's totally _wrong_ with it!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA,Try pressing PLAY just to see if you can get through anyway.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_ADA_HINT1,There's no way forward unless we at least try! Press PLAY.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA,"That Instruction does some biZarre things to me! Not digging it at all. 

And I for sure can’t get through this level with that Instruction in the mix.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT1_AUTO5_FAILURE_ADA2,"Right. There must be a syntax error, but to be sure we’ll need to see the code.

To see the code, we’ll need the Instructions panel key. Oh boy, here we go. Saniel probably has it. ",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_SUCCESS,"Hey guys! I just checked in with Saniel. He was indeed half-asleep.

But he says we can find that key inside Lightspeed.  

He stashed it there long ago ""to keep it safe,"" LOL. Saniel never forgets anything!

Meet me at the clubhouse, and we’ll go find it together.",Faber,hurray,,
MAZEPT1_ABORT,Come find me later and we can keep working on this! ,Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_ROBOTSPITS,"More Pits, and Robots too. Nothing you haven't seen before, though.

You got this, Riley! Leave 'em coughing in the data-dust!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT1_MOREROBOTSPITS,"... I suppose we should have expected this.

There seems to be a pattern in the way these challenges build on each other.

That means you know how to handle this. Go for it!",Ada,,,
MAZEPT1_WASTEJUMPS,"Hmm. You know, you don't have to have a pit in front of you to use a `JUMP`. 

Maybe that's the way forward?",Ada,,,
