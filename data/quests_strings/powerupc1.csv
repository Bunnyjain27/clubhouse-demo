POWERUPC1_QUEST_ACCEPT,As always!,,,,
POWERUPC1_LAUNCH,Start by launching Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPC1_EXPLAIN,Now we're going to create powerup 3. Go to the coding panel.,,,,

POWERUPC1_PLAYTEST,Those powerups should shrink our ship now...,,,,
POWERUPC1_NOSHRINK,The ship doesn't seem to be shrinking for some reason. Let's check the code.,,,,
POWERUPC1_FINISHLEVEL,There you go. It should make finishing the level much easier.,,,,
POWERUPC1_SUCCESS,Perfect. A few more tweaks on this powerup and we'll be almost ready.,,,,
POWERUPC1_ABORT,"OK, we can do it later.",,,,
