LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUESTION,Ready for your next coding assignment?,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN,"I'd like you to add the enemies for level 7, we should have all three kinds of enemies.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,You should go to the code view as usual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE,"Look for the spawnEnemy() function and make sure to return all 3 kinds of enemies: asteroid, beam, and squid.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT1,You could pick one at random to spawn every second.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT2,Or you could even spawn all 3 every time!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT3,,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_PLAYING,Let's see if we get all 3 enemies...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_NOENEMIES,Enemies are rather lacking. Are you sure you spawned some? Go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SOMENEMIES,We're missing some enemy types. Go back and make sure to spawn all 3 types.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SUCCESS,That solution is correct. Well done. Perhaps you could use a XXXXX?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_END,You can have it. There are lots of interesting things that can be built with it. Bye.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
