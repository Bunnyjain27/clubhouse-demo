LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUESTION,Ready for your next coding assignment?,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_LAUNCH,Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN,I'd like you to add the enemies for Level 7. But this time we should have *two* different kinds of enemies at once.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,You should go to the code view as usual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE,"Click on the Enemies tab and look for the `spawnEnemy()` function as usual.

Whenever it's time to spawn an enemy make sure to return two kinds of enemies: *asteroid*, *spinner*, or *squid*.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT1,How do you pick one random number? That's right: the `random()` function.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT2,"And how do use it to pick one of two things? We could do `random(1,2)`.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT3,And all of that in an `if` statement to pick one enemy or the other.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT4,"So when it's time to spawn: `if (random(1,2) == 1) return 'asteroid'; return 'squid';'",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT5,All of that after `if (ticksSinceSpawn > 40) {...}` of course.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_CODE_HINT6,Make sure to test it in the game!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_PLAYING,Let's see if we get *two* types of enemies...,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_NOENEMIES,Enemies are rather lacking. Are you sure you spawned some? Go back and check.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SOMENEMIES,We're missing some enemy types. Go back and make sure to spawn at least *two* types.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SUCCESS,That solution is correct. Well done. Perhaps you could use a *hush gasket*.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_END,You can have it. There are lots of interesting things that can be built with it. Bye.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
