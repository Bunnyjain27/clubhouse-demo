HTMLINTRO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to play with HTML text sizes, styles, and images! (Part 3)",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_1,"Last time, we figured out HTML colors, but you're probably wondering if you can change text in other ways.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_2,"*Yes, you can.* I mean, I've been doing it this whole time!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_3,"Let's get back into that HTML previewer, I've got a new page for you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_4,"Like last time, if it doesn't open, try opening Chrome...",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_5,Or clicking the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/oNNYNXB?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_6,"You'll notice that there's more text this time, so let's make the first paragraph stand out! Add the tags `<b>` and `</b>` around the first sentence.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_7,"Bold! People usually put the first `<b>` tag after the opening `<p>` tag, but it's not required.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_8,"You can also use italics (I can't, I'm jealous!) - put `<i>` and `</i>` around some text.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_9,You can even combine bold and italics - just put both sets of tags around the same text.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_10,"Now let's try changing the size of the text. Size works like colors, so it goes into the `<p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_11,"Try `<p style=""font-size:200%"">` on a paragraph.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_12,"See how that's similar to what we did with colors? We're adding another 'style' to the text, but this one talks about size.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_13,"You can also use words like *xx-large* and *small* for `font-size`, instead of percentages.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_14,"Here's something cool - Since both colors and sizes are just adding styles to the `<p>` tag, you can combine them!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_15,"Try making some of the text double-size, and red. Use a semicolon (;) to end one style and start the next.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_16,"You should have something like `<p style=""font-size:200%; color:red"">` - Notice where the semicolon is.",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_17,"I take back what I said earlier - now *THAT* pops. Remember, you can also add these styles to `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and so on.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_18,"Now that you know how to make text look different, how about we add an image?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_19,"To show an image: `<img src=""http://www.w3schools.com/html/img_chania.jpg"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_20,"You can read the first part as *image source*. The next part is where the image is located - for this, on another website.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_21,"Nice. While we're here, think about the way that tag is written. Does that look familliar?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_22,Think back to `p style`. Look at the first part of those two tags:,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_23,"`<img src=""https://...`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_24,"`<p style=""color...`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_25,"Do you see how they use a similar structure? HTML has consistent rules that you can learn, like any language. ",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_26,"If you can master the rules of HTML, you'll be able to use any tag in existence!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_END,Awesome work! Come back again and we're going to tie it all together... there's a secret trick that makes a lot of this easier.,riley,,,
