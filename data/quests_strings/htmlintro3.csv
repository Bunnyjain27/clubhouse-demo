HTMLINTRO3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn how to play with HTML text sizes, more styles, and images! (Part 3)",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_1,You're probably wondering if you can change text in other ways than just the color.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_2,"*Yes, you can.* I mean, I've been doing it this whole time!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_3,"Let's get back into that HTML previewer, I've got a new page for you.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_4,"Like last time, if it doesn't open, try opening your web browser.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_5,You can also click the link - https://codepen.io/madetohack/pen/oNNYNXB?editors=1000,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_6,"You'll notice that there's more text this time, so let's make the first paragraph stand out! Add the tags `<b>` and `</b>` around the first sentence.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_7,"Bold! You might have noticed that after you typed the opening `<b>` tag, everything in the entire page went bold until you typed the closing `</b>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_8,"If you don't close tags, they apply until the end of the page, which is pretty much never what you want. So if you see something wierd, check your tags!",,,,
HTMLINTRO3_9,"Along with bold text, you can also use italics, by putting `<i>` and `</i>` around some text. You can even combine bold and italics - just put both sets of tags around the same text.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_10,"Now, let's try changing the size of the text. Size works like color, so it goes inside the `<p>` tag.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_11,"Try `<p style=""font-size:200%"">` on a paragraph.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_12,"See how that's similar to what we did with colors? We're adding another 'style' to the text, but this one talks about size.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_13,"You can also use words like *xx-large* and *small* for `font-size`, instead of percentages. Here's a link to the W3Schools page with all the sizes: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_14,"Now, we know that colors and sizes are just adding styles to the `<p>` tag, so check this out - You can combine them!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_15,"Let's make the text in one of the `<p>` tags double-size and red: `<p style=""font-size:200%; color:red"">` Do you see where the semicolon (;) is?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_16,The semicolon tells the broswer that we're separating 2 different formatting instructions.,,,,
HTMLINTRO3_17,"I take back what I said earlier - now *THAT* pops. Remember, you can also add these styles to `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and so on.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_18,"Great work so far! Now that you know how to make text look different, how adding an image?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_19,The `<img>` tag is different than the other ones we've seen so far. It *requires* some additional information in order to work.,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_20,"You can't just type `<img>`, it needs the web address of the image to display, otherwise there's nothing for the browser to show!",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_21,"So, let's try this - `<img src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/8107/8669890808_e6c590c35b_b.jpg"">`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_22,"The `src` part of the tag you can think of as the *source*. That's where the image is located. In this case, it's on another website.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_23,"While we're here, think about the way that tag is written. Does that look familliar?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_24,Think back to when we were styling text (`p style`) and how that tag was written. Look at the first parts of those two tags:,riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_25,"`<img src=""https://...`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_26,"`<p style=""color...`",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_27,"Notice how there's a tag (`p` or `img`), then a modifier (`style` or `src`), and then information that applies to that modifier?",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_28,"HTML has consistent rules that you can learn, like any language. All tags follow this same basic format, and most of them even accept the same modifiers.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_29,"If you can master the rules of HTML, you'll be able to use any tag, even ones you've never seen before.",riley,,,
HTMLINTRO3_END,"Awesome work! I'll be waiting in the Clubhouse to show you a secret trick that ties all of this together, and makes it a lot easier, too.",riley,,,
