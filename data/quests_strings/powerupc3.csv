POWERUPC3_QUESTION,One more tweak to the powerup.,,,,
POWERUPC3_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,,
POWERUPC3_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
POWERUPC3_EXPLAIN,"For the final touch, let's add another possible random upgrade to the ship. Go to the code.",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE,"Now you're trying to give one of 3 upgrades at random, so the random number should be between 1 and 3.",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT1,,,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT2,"That would make it `var r = random(1,3);`",,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT3,And then you'll need another `if` statment checking for 3 and giving that upgrade.,,,,
POWERUPC3_CODE_HINT4,`if (r == 3) ship.engineTimer = 5;`,,,,
POWERUPC3_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and try the level as usual.,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAYTEST,You should be able to get all 3 types of upgrades as you play the level...,,,,
POWERUPC3_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press *Restart.*,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAY_AGAIN,Let's try that level again!,,,,
POWERUPC3_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Press *Restart.*,,,,
POWERUPC3_NOTTHREE,You didn't get all 3 types of upgrades. Weird. See what's going on with that code.,,,,
POWERUPC3_NO_UPGRADE,That powerup didn't give any upgrade to the ship. Go back and see if an upgrade is specified.,,,,
POWERUPC3_OTHER_PICKED,Did you mean to pick a powerup of a different type?,,,,
POWERUPC3_NOT_PICKED,No powerup? Every tiny thing matters in code! Check to make sure they're actually being spawned.,,,,
