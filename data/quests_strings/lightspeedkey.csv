LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUESTION,Ready to go get that key from Lightspeed?,faber,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_QUEST_ACCEPT,Can't wait. Let's go!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH,First let's launch *Lightspeed*.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the *Lightspeed* icon on the desktop.        ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELSINTRO,"The next three levels are OLD ones, so the challenges are weird! But the key we need is at the end.

Aaaand, some of the *Topics* aren't available! When you do see a *Topic*, jump on your chance to hack the level! ",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1,"I recommend you try each level out first so you can see what challenge it poses.

Then when you flip to the *Toolbox*, I'll be standing by to help. Maybe we can change these Squids!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS1_HINT1,Play this level and see what approach it requires. Then click the *Flip* button and get in there!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2,"Good work! One level down, two to go! See what's up with this level. Then flip to hack.",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS2_HINT1,"Wow, the astronauts are tiny and they zoom super fast! Maybe a Power-Up can attract them?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3,Last level! Almost there! The key waits for you when you win this level!,,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_LEVELS3_HINT1,Play this level to see why it's hard. Then flip to hack.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_LOCKED,This *Topic* isn't available on this level!  How can you solve it with another *Topic*?,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_GAME,"You change the size of your ship and the astronauts in this *Topic*!

You can also change the speed and appearance of your ship.

This is a really handy *Topic*, because it has some other powerful parameters too.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPAWN,"You can edit the code in this *Topic* to change which enemies appear, and how often they appear.

If you make 40 larger enemies, they will appear less often. 

If you make them smaller, they will appear more often.

Where it says 'asteroid' you can substitute different types to change which enemy spawns.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_ASTEROID,The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Asteroids.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SPINNER,The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Spinners.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID,"The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors for an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Squids.

If you're having problems with Squid enemies, maybe you can fix it here.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT1,"Do you see where it says `enemy.position.y'? That tells the Squid where to be on the screen.

If `enemy.position.y` is 0, that's the bottom of the screen. Higher numbers are towards the top.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT2,"This code gets called every instant to tell the Squid what new screen position it should have.

If it says `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 0;` that means set the new position to the current position.

It actually says `+ 0` but when you add zero to something the number doesn't change.

And with no change, the Squid's position stays the same as it was.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_SQUID_HINT3,"So you can tell every Squid where to be on the screen every instant! What can you do with that?

They would move upwards with `enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + 5;` or a higher number than 5.

Or you could just set their position to a fixed number with NO changes like `enemy.position.y = 500;`",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_BEAM,The code in these *Topics* creates behaviors of an enemy type. This *Topic* works for Beams.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_PANEL_POWERUPS,The code in this *Topic* changes how Power-ups work.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_SUCCESS,"Such skillful work getting through those levels! 

And excellent work getting that key! We can use that back in *Sidetrack*!",,hurray,,
LIGHTSPEEDKEY_ABORT,No problem. Come back when you're ready.,,,,
