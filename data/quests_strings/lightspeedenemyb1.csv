LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUESTION,Perhaps you're ready to code a whole new enemy on your own?,Saniel,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_LAUNCH,Start by launching LightSpeed.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_EXPLANATION,We'll add this enemy to level 6. Press the Flip button to go to the coding panel.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1,Here we are. Start by spawning 'squid' in the spawn_enemy() function. Then play the level to test it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NEWENEMY,"Perfect. That's the new enemy type, although it's not doing anything interesting yet. Let's fix that.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NEWENEMY_HINT1,Go to the coding panel. Press flip to hack.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOENEMY,Hmm... not quite. We don't have any of that enemy in the level. Go back and try to fix it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2,"Excellent. Now go to the update_enemy() function. If we leave it blank, it'll do nothing, like an asteroid.

Let's have it move up and down like the other enemy, but smoothly, using the sine function.

sin() is a function that creates a smooth wave over time. So set y = sin(this.time); and try it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAY2,"Hmm... that enemy isn't moving much, is it? That's because sin() returns a number between -1 and 1!

So right now it's just moving a pixel up and down. Go back to the code and let's change it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE3,"How can we make it move more but still use the sin() function? Multiplying it of course!

Multiply sin(this.time) by some number to make it larger. Go ahead and try it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAY3,"Much better! That number you chose is the amplitude of the sine wave.

Now let's have it move with that amplitude, but slower. Go back to the code.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE4,"The sine wave will depend on the parameter we pass it. In this case it's this.time. So if we multiply time by 0.5, we'll slow it down.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SUCCESS,Excellent! Great job coding your first enemy from scratch!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABORT,Abort,,,
