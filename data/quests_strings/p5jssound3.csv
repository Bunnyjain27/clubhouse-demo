P5JSSOUND3_QUEST_NAME,P5JS - Painting with Sound - Part 3,,,,
P5JSSOUND3_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSSOUND3_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In the last part of this set of quests, you'll put together all the elements you've used so far to get things <b>really</b> crazy!",,,,
P5JSSOUND3_1,"Welcome back, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Are you ready to put on a real light show? I know I am!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_2,"First things first - let's get back to the p5.js code editor. You can load your previous sketch (if you saved it at <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">http://editor.p5js.org),</span></u> or get back to where we left off with this one: <u><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#3584E4"">https://editor.p5js.org/madetohack/sketches/HNfYgEbV</span></u>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_3,"Last time, we learned how to detect louder elements and use that in a creative way.  ",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_4,"Now, let's add some more elements to the mix.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_5,"Let's create another condition that says <b>if the volume is greater than 0.2</b> then <b>draw a line</b> with a <b>random color</b>, <b>from a random X, Y location</b> to another <b>random X,Y location</b>!",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_6,"Ok, that sounds like a lot, but we can break it down into pieces.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_7,"First let's create our <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if</span></tt> condition statment: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">if (volume &gt; 0.2) { }</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_8,"Inside it let's create a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line();</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_9,"A <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line</span></tt> expects four numbers. The first two numbers are the X and Y coordinates for where the line starts and the next two numbers are the X and Y coordinates for where the line ends.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_10,"We can use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random(width)</span></tt> for our two X coordinates and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">random(height)</span></tt> for our two Y coordinates.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_11,"So, all together, that should be <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line(random(width), random(height), random(width), random(height));</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_12,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line</span></tt> is different from <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">circle</span></tt> - you can't fill <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line</span></tt>s with color. Instead, we have to change the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke</span></tt>, or outline, of our line.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_13,"While we are adding a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke</span></tt>, let's use our random R, G, B values that we set up last time.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_14,"Add the line <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">stroke(r, g, b);</span></tt> above the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">line(random(width), random(height), random(width), random(height));</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_15,"Now let's make our stroke thicker by adding the line: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">strokeWeight(5);</span></tt>",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_16,Run this and see what happens!,daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_17,"Try experimenting by changing the 5 in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">strokeWeight(5)</span></tt> to another value.",daemon,,,
P5JSSOUND3_18,"Now that we have a music painter going, put on some tunes and watch your creation go! Party time!",daemon,,,
