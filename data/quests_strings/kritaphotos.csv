KRITAPHOTOS_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start with a photo, end with a work of art! You'll learn to change the look of a photograph and add all kinds of decorations.",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_QUEST_NOTINSTALLED,"Uh-oh! Looks like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Krita</span></tt> isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center if you'd like to learn how to use it.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, then search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Krita</span></tt>, and install it. ",,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_1,"Hey there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Good to see you again. ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_2,"Let's get going! I'll open Krita for you, and then you'll need to open up a file called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Photos.kra</span></tt>. Like last time, look in the center of your screen and click <b>Open File</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_3,"A box should open with a file browser in it. Using that file browser, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser), then navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>KritaSources</b>. Once you're there, open up <b>Photos.kra</b>",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_4,"Now, you might think this file just has <b>one</b> photo in it. But you'd be wrong!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_5,"Check the <b>Layers</b>. Remember where they are, over to the right? We've got a couple different ones this time.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_6,Now I'm gonna show you a cool trick. You can make <b>Layers</b> appear and disappear.,daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_7,"See the <b>rounded eye symbol</b> to the <b>left</b> of each <b>Layer</b>? Click on one. The eye turns grey and closes, symbolizing that we can't see that <b>Layer</b> anymore.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_8,Try hiding and showing different layers until you've seen all 3 photos.,daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_9,"Now hide all the layers except your favorite, and make sure you have that one selected. Otherwise you won't be able to make any changes to it.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_10,"Now, we're going to use the <b>brush tool</b>, on the left. Select the little paintbrush near the top left of the Tools section. It's called the Freehand Brush Tool, and it will let us draw on top of the picture.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_11,"See the toolbar on the right, just below the Layers? That's the Brush Presets toolbar. The Freehand Brush Tool can use any of the Brush Presets, which will let you draw with any number of brushes, markers, stamps, and swirls! ",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_12,"There are tons of Brush Presets to choose from! If you want, you can trim down the list so it's easier to read - See where it says 'All' under the 'Brush Presets' label? That's a dropdown menu where you can pick categories. Here are some of my favorites...",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_13,"I like 'FX' because it's like adding cool effects, layered on top of your picture. 'Textures' will lay down some really cool looking patterns. And 'Digital' has all kinds of exciting brushes, including some that make it look like you're bending reality!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_14,"To try a brush, just click on it. Make sure you still have the Freehand Brush Tool (paintbrush) selected on the left! Now click or drag it across your picture to see what happens.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_15,"If you don't like it, you can always Undo. For any changes that you don't like, just press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt> or hit the Undo arrow up top.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_16,Don't forget that you can also select different colors for the brushes.,daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_17,"Are you ready for some more ways to change your brush? You can change the <b>Size</b> of your brush, making star sparkles and things as big or small as you want. (Yeah, there's really a brush that makes shiny stars.)",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_18,"Look up at the very top right of the window, where you'll see a bar that says 'Size' and has a number with 'px.' That 'px' stands for pixels - how many pixels your brush will cover up.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_19,"See how some of the bar is filled in and some of it is empty? You can click or drag to change the size. If your brush gets too big, it'll cover the whole page. If it's too small, you might not see the changes.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_20,"Now, are you ready for even MORE customization?",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_21,"First, it's time to Save! Hey, don't look at me like that. Nobody likes losing their art, trust me. ""Save early and often!""",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_22,"Now, you can also make whatever you paint look see-through! This is called changing the Opacity (something you can't see through is <b>opaque</b>, the opposite of <b>transparent</b>).",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_23,"Look for the Opacity bar next to the Size bar. It probably says 100%, but you can change it. Try different numbers and see how it changes the look of your additions.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_24,"Got it? You're doing great. There's a million ways to make art with Krita, so once you find something you like, <b>just go for it</b>! You can always come back and explore more later.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_25,"I like to use the keyboard shortcuts you can see in the View &lt; Canvas menu. Just click the 'View' menu, then hover over the 'Canvas' option. You can zoom in or out here. If you memorize the keyboard shortcut, you don't even have to open these menus again!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_26,"Now, let's say you wanted a brush from five minutes ago, but you don't remember where to find it. Good news! You can still find it in 'Brush Preset History,' the tab right next to 'Brush Presets.'",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_27,"This will give you a list of your most recent brushes and you can click to select the one you want. When you're done, just click on the 'Brush Presets' tab again to look for new ones.",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_28,"If you're feeling inspired, you might want to decorate more. Try using photos of friends and family! Create the photos you want to see in the world!",daemon2,,,
KRITAPHOTOS_29,"Have fun, and see you next time!",daemon2,,,
