WOBBLYBASH_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
WOBBLYBASH_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Get your windows wobbling like Jello through the power of OS scripting!,,,,
WOBBLYBASH_1,"Greetings. Are you ready to take a step into actual programming, *{{user_name}}*?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_2,I thought you might be. Excellent. Let's get started - open the Terminal and get comfortable.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_3,Did you know that this humble Terminal prompt is the most powerful tool on your computer? You can do the most amazing work... or make the worst mistake of your month... using the Terminal.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_4,"So, more than any other adventure you've done so far, this one requires precision and accuracy. If you get an error, or unexpected results - be sure you typed everything correctly!",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_5,"Now, the Terminal doesn't just expose hundreds of commands. It also lets you string them together in sequence, which we usually call a *shell script*.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_6,"Why would you want to use a shell script, though? Well, what if you had a command that filled most of this text box?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_7,Maybe it would be something like `settings-program set rocket.ship takeoff-speed 2000`.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_8,"I think we can both agree that command is a little too long to be convenient or easy to remember, nothing like `ls` or `cd`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_9,Wouldn't it be useful if we could create something that would run several commands like that in a row?,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_10,"In order to create such a file, you need to use a new tool - `nano`, a text editor that lives entirely within the Terminal. Start it by typing `nano` and pressing `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_11,"`nano` is quite simple - Move the cursor with the arrow keys, use `Ctrl + O` (that's O as in Original) to save, use `Ctrl + X` to quit, and look at the Status Bar at the bottom of the window to see any information the program wants to give you.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_12,"`nano` is truly a program of the Terminal - no mouse support here, so stretch out your typing fingers! Now, let's try some simple operations.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_13,"Type some text in your `nano` window, maybe ""Stonehenge is cool!"", save your file as *stone*, and then quit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_14,"To do all that, you'd type your text, press `Ctrl + O` to save, look at the bottom of the window to see the save prompt, type `stone`, press `Enter`, and then press `Ctrl + X` to exit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_15,"Once you do all that, you'll be back at the command-line. If you type `ls`, you should see a file named `stone`. `nano` will save files in your current directory (where you ran it) unless you say otherwise.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_16,"Now, let's look at that file you just created. Type `nano stone` to open the file named `stone` with `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_17,"Here we are again. Good work. Now, let's try turning this stone into a tool.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_18,"Delete all your text, and replace it with `echo ""Clunk, clunk, crash!""` . `echo` is a command that lets us show text in the Terminal when we run our script -can you guess where we're going with this?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_19,"Now, save your file, and quit back to the prompt.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_20,Let's see if our tool works - type `bash stone`,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_21,"Indeed, that's the sound you might have heard long ago, as Stonehenge was being chipped out of the quarries!",saniel,hurray,,
WOBBLYBASH_22,"Alright, enough joking around - let's do something useful!",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_23,"There's an interesting shortcut for creating a new file with `nano`: You can ""open"" a file that doesn't exist yet, and `nano` will behave as though you created a new file with that name. Try `nano myscript.sh`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_24,"Do you see? `nano` shows ""New File"" at the bottom of the screen. You need to save to actually write this file to disk, but if you do, (`Ctrl + O`) you'll already have the filename filled in and you can just press `Enter`. Do that now.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_25,"Excellent. Now we have a file to experiment with. Let's type in a nice, long command: `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-object-movement-range 500`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_26,"On the next line, type in `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect true`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_27,"On the third line, type `echo ""wobbly settings applied""`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_28,"Good work. These commands will now run, in sequence, whenever this file is called up. Double-check your typing, Save, and then close `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_29,"Once `nano` is closed, we can run the script - type `bash myscript.sh` and then press `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_30,"If that script printed ""wobbly settings applied"", you can try grabbing the Terminal window and dragging it around...",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_31,"Oh ho, well done! You've turned all those windows into jelly, look  at then squish and squash! Personally, this is my favorite little secret about the operating system.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_32,"Now, at some point in the far, far future, you might get tired of this effect and want to turn it off. Can you figure out what command you might need to enter to do that? I'll give you a hint - look into the script you just wrote, the answer is hidden there.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_33,"If you guessed that you might need to use `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect *false*`, you're at the head of the class. Now, here's the next level of challenge: Can you figure out how to make a new script that runs that command?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_34,"Here's how I'd do it: First, type `nano wobblyoff.sh` to create a new file and open it in `nano`. Next, type `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect false`, then `echo ""wobbly effects off""` on the next line.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_35,"Finally, save the file and quit `nano`, then run that script by typing `bash wobblyoff.sh`. You might need to close and reopen the Terminal to see the window wobble go away completely.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_36,Excellent work! I imagine that your brain might be feeling a little jelly-like after all that.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_37,"What you've done here is a tiny little peek into the inner workings of your system. Imagine: programs made of programs, which are in turn made up of more programs, and so on...",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_38,"This computer that you're using is a giant chain of programs. `nano` runs in the shell, which runs in the Terminal, which runs inside the window manager, which runs inside the desktop, _et cetera_. It's programs all the way down!",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_39,"Quite a rabbit-hole, isn't it? And think - it's all at your fingertips.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_40,"In the future, we'll explore more of the possibilities of shell scripting - and I must confess I'm looking forward to it. You're quite a good student.",saniel,,,
