WOBBLYBASH_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Get your windows wobbling like Jello through the power of OS scripting!,,,,
WOBBLYBASH_1,"Greetings. Are you ready to take a step into actual programming, *{{user_name}}*?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_2,I thought you might be. Excellent. Let's get started - open the Terminal and get comfortable.,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_3,"As you look at this humble text prompt, realize that this is the key to the most powerful tools on your computer. The Terminal exposes vast amounts of commands and settings that there are no other ways to reach. You can do the most amazing work, or make the worst mistake of your month using the Terminal.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_4,"In addition to exposing hundreds of commands, you can create commands in the Terminal that are made up of sequences of other commands. We usually call these *shell scripts*.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_5,"But first, why would you want to use a shell script? You can enter commands into the Terminal without any trouble, correct?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_6,What about this one? `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-object-movement-range 500`,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_7,"I think we can both agree that command is a little too long to be convenient or easy to remember, nothing like `ls` or `cd`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_8,"So, what if we could create a file that would run several commands like that in a row? That would be rather useful, wouldn't it?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_9,"In order to create such a file, you need to use a new tool - `nano`, a text editor that lives entirely within the Terminal. Start it by typing `nano` and pressing `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_10,"`nano` is quite simple - You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, use `Ctrl + O` (that's O as in Oscar) to save, use `Ctrl + X` to quit, and look at the Status Bar at the bottom of the window to see any information the program wants to give you.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_11,"Really, that's it. Let's try some simple operations. Type some text (""Stonehenge is cool!""), save your file, naming it ""stone"", and then quit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_12,"To do all that, you'd type your text, press `Ctrl + O`, look at the bottom of the window to see the save prompt, type `s`-`t`-`o`-`n`-`e`, press `Enter`, and then press `Ctrl + X`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_13,"Once you do all that, you'll be back at the command-line. If you type `ls`, you should see a file named `stone`. `nano` will save files in your current directory (where you ran it) unless you say otherwise.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_14,"Now, let's look at that file you just created. Type `nano stone` to open the file named `stone` with `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_15,Here we are again. Good work. Let's quit again (`Ctrl + X`).,saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_16,"There's an interesting shortcut for creating a new file with `nano`: You can ""open"" a file that doesn't exist yet, and `nano` will behave as though you created a new file with that name. Try `nano myscript.sh`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_17,"Do you see? `nano` shows ""New File"" at the bottom of the screen. You need to save to actually write this file to disk, but if you do, (`Ctrl + O`) you'll already have the filename filled in and you can just press `Enter`. Do that now.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_18,"Excellent. Now we have a file to experiment with. Let's enter a nice, long command that you'd never want to type twice if you could avoid it: `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-object-movement-range 500`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_19,"On the next line, type `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-spring-friction 2.0`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_20,"And on the third line, `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect true`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_21,"Last, on the fourth line, type `echo ""wobbly settings applied""`",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_22,"Good work. We just entered a sequence of commands, followed by `echo`, which lets you print text to the command-line. It's useful for seeing what a program is doing. Let's save, and then close `nano`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_23,"Once `nano` is closed, we can run the script - type `bash myscript.sh` and then press `Enter`.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_24,"If that script printed ""wobbly settings applied"", you can try grabbing the Terminal window and dragging it around...",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_25,"Well done! You've turned all those windows into jelly, quite a feat.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_26,"Now, of course, you might want to turn that off. Can you figure out what command you might need to enter to do that? Type `nano myscript.sh` to take a look at the commands again, if you like.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_27,"If you guessed that you might need to use `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect *false*`, you're at the head of the class. Now, here's the next level: Can you figure out how to make a new script that runs that command?",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_28,"Let me walk you through how I'd do that: First, I'd type `nano wobblyoff.sh` to make a new  script and open it in `nano`. Then, I'd type `gsettings set org.gnome.shell wobbly-
effect false` into the file, followed by `echo ""wobbly effects off""`, then save and quit.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_29,"Finally, I'd run that script by typing `bash wobblyoff.sh`. You might need to close and reopen the Terminal to see the window wobble go away completely.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_30,"I imagine you're feeling a bit squeezed out after that - It's a lot to take in. I'll explain a few things I skipped over, earlier.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_31,"You need to type `bash` before your script name because `bash` is your shell. To run a shell script, you need to ask the shell... which is also the program that gives you a command prompt. I realize that might be confusing, but let me explain.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_32,"You see, you're actually running a massive chain of programs to use this computer. When you run `nano`, that's a program running inside `bash`(the shell), which is a program running inside the Terminal, which runs inside the desktop... It's programs all the way down.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_33,"And now, with shell scripting, you can create your own programs by stitching together still more programs, all of which run inside the shell.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_34,"Quite a rabbit-hole, isn't it? Just think - it's all at your fingertips.",saniel,,,
WOBBLYBASH_35,"In the future, we'll explore more of the possibilities of shell scripting - and I must confess I'm looking forward to it. You're quite a good student.",saniel,,,
