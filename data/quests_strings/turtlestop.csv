TURTLESTOP_QUEST_NAME,Turtling Up: Meeting the Turtle!,,,,
TURTLESTOP_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
TURTLESTOP_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Riley has a new friend she'd like you to meet - The Turtle! He's the best friend to learn programming with!,,,,
TURTLESTOP_1,"Hey <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Everyone learns differently, so we're going to learn programming in a different way today. I want to introduce you to the <b>Turtle</b>!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_2,I'll open up <b>TurtleBlocks</b> for you - but you can always find it on the <b>Desktop</b>.,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_3,"OK! This program is how we're going to interact with the <b>Turtle</b>. The <b>Turtle</b> is little software ""creature"" that you can give orders to. Using the blocks in this program, you can tell the <b>Turtle</b> how to move. ",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_4,"The <b>Turtle</b> leaves a trail behind it, and you can use the trail to draw shapes and experiment with programming! Yeah, that's right - giving orders to the <b>Turtle</b> is a kind of programming!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_5,"TurtleBlocks has a lot of buttons, but don't worry. The top bar of buttons is mostly used for switching between different groups of instructions for the <b>Turtle</b>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_6,"To use an instruction, you first click the button for the group you want, then drag the instruction you want into the <b>blue area</b>, and connect it to the other instructions to make it work.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_7,"Let's start with something simple. We'll just tell the turtle to move, turn, and move again.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_8,"Click the button with an image of a <b>Turtle</b> in the upper left to open the ""Turtle"" command group. From there, drag out 4 instructions: 2 forwards, and 2 lefts. ",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_9,"Once you have them out on the field, drag them into the 'jaws' of the <b>Start block</b> so that they're in the order <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward, left, forward, left</span></tt>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_10,You can leave all the numbers as they are - now click the <b>Snail</b> button on the far right end of the top bar to get the <b>Turtle</b> moving!,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_11,"Cool, huh? The turtle starts looking for instructions at the beginning of the 'jaws' of the <b>Start block</b>, and then marches down the list until it gets to the end.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_12,"In this case, you told the <b>Turtle</b> to go forward, then left, then forward, then left again. When you give the <b>Turtle</b> directions, it acts from its current point of view, which is why it ended up facing the bottom of the screen after the second left.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_13,"Let's try changing the details of those commands - the turtle doesn't always have to turn 90 degrees left, after all!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_14,"Double-click the purple boxes in the commands and change them to 200, 45, 50, 45 - The turtle will now move farther and turn less sharply.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_15,Click the Snail button again and see how the turtle responds to your changes.,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_16,"You can try changing the order of the instructions if you like - see how it changes the turtle's behavior! You can also click the <b>eraser</b> button on the top row of buttons, right next to the <b>rabbit</b> button, to clear the <b>Turtle</b>'s drawing's away.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_17,"Let's use the <b>Turtle</b> to draw a triangle. We'll need a total of 3 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> instructions, but we'll only need 2 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> instructions. With those limits, can you think of how to make the <b>Turtle</b> draw a triangle?",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_18,"If you try it, you'll see that it's more complex than you think!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_19,"The way to solve this is to remember that the sum of <b>inner</b> angles of a triangle is 180 degrees... but what about the <b>outer</b> angles? Each one of those is equal to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">180 degrees - the inner angle</span></tt>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_20,"So, to draw a triangle, have your turns be 120 degrees. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">180 - 120 = 60</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">60 * 3 = 180</span></tt>, the sum of all the angles in a triangle! Also, all your sides will need to be the same length - if a triangle's angles are all the same, the sides need to be the same too!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_21,"Great triangle! If you drew an equilateral triangle, try drawing a right triangle! You can also play around with the commands to draw other shapes.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_22,Drawing a shape is fun - but it's kind of a pain to drag all those instructions around and change the values for all of them. What if there was a way to do it faster?,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_23,"Click the ""circling arrows"" button at the top of the screen to open another command group, and drag the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block into the blue area.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_24,"Now, drag a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> block and a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block into the 'jaws' of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_25,"Remove all the other blocks from the 'jaws' of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Start</span></tt> block, and drag the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block in. You can just leave the other blocks hanging around - if they aren't connected to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">start</span></tt>, the <b>Turtle</b> can't see them!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_26,"Set your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> block's number to <b>75</b>, and your <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block's number to <b>45</b> by double-clicking the purple boxes on each block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_27,"Double-click the purple box on the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> node and set the number to 8.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_28,"Now, press the <b>Snail</b> button and away we go!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_29,"Cool, huh? That's an octagon!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_30,"But, you know, I can think of something even better than an octagon's 8 fantastic sides and 8 awesome angles...",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_31,We're going to use every tool we have in TurtleBlocks to create something really cool! ^_^,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_32,"OK, first, let's get make sure our shape is filled in - Switch to the 'pencil' command group, and grab the 'start fill' and 'end fill' blocks. Put <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">start fill</span></tt> before the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block, and put <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">end fill</span></tt> after the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">repeat</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_33,"Whenever you're trying to do a specific thing, it's always important to test your programs! Let's test our filled-in shape by clicking the snail button!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_34,Nice. If you don't see what we're doing.... think about why we might have left the <b>Turtle</b> colored red!,riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_35,"This next set of instructions is pretty specific - I figured them out ahead of time and it took me a little while to get the right values, so check your work carefully!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_36,"We're gonna need a shopping list-worth of new nodes to make this work, so let's get going.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_37,"From the ""Turtle"" command group, we need a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> block, a <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">right</span></tt> block, and 2 <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_38,"From the ""Pencil"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen down</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_39,"From the ""Colors"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">white</span></tt> block.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_40,"From the ""Notebook"" command group we need the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set scale</span></tt>, and <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">show</span></tt> blocks.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_41,"Now that you've dragged all those nodes out, let's get them all into the correct order.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_42,"Below <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">end fill</span></tt>, add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt> - This will stop the <b>Turtle</b> from drawing any lines while we do some precise movement!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_43,"After <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">pen up</span></tt>, add <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">left</span></tt> with a value of <b>90</b>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> with a value of <b>178</b>, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">right</span></tt> with a value of <b>90</b>, and then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">forward</span></tt> with a value of <b>28</b>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_44,"Next, it's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Pen down</span></tt>, then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt>, and drag our <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">white</span></tt> block into the little slot on the right side of <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set color</span></tt>.",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_45,"Then <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">set scale</span></tt> with a value of <b>100</b>, and finally, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">show</span></tt> with a value of <b>STOP</b>!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_46,"Now it's time to test everything! If you want to clean out the screen first, you can press the Eraser button, but otherwise, press the Snail button and watch our <b>Turtle</b> go! Watch as the instructions change color while the program runs. If anything goes wrong, you'll see where it happens!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_47,"If everything is right, you should have a stop sign... which, of course, is an octagon!",riley,,,
TURTLESTOP_48,"Try experimenting with all the instructions we used to do this - you should have a pretty good idea of what they do if you watched the <b>Turtle</b> step through them. As a challenge, try making a Stop sign that's twice as big as this one! Or maybe, if you're feeling confident, try making a Yield sign!",riley,,,
