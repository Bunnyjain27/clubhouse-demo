BREAKINGIN_ARCHIVIST,"What's going on here? Didn't I tell you â€“ What happened to the trap? Why is it active?

What? Riley was sucked into the AI trap? What have you done? This is one of my old traps, but it shouldn't be active now.

Looks like the AI's are getting stronger again and we're under attack.

Our first priority is to rescue Riley, but I'm going to need your help for that.",Saniel,,,quests/saniel-theme-start
BREAKINGIN_ABORT,Not up for it right now? We can try again later. ,,,,
