POWERUPA1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it.,,,,
POWERUPA1_LAUNCH,"Remember, one of the codes to remove the shield of the AI trap is in deep inside Lightspeed.

We'll need to create a level with every enemy and powerup in the game. Let's launch Lightspeed.",,,,

Let's go to the coding panel. ",,,,
POWERUPA1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab. See that `spawnPowerup()` function? That's what creates powerups.

It returns a number with the type of powerup. 0 means no powerup. Change it to a 1 and try the level.",,,,
POWERUPA1_CODE_HINT1,Set `return 1;` and play the level.,,,,

POWERUPA1_FINISHLEVEL,"Excellent. The powerups are there, although they don't do anything let. Finish the level now.",,,,
