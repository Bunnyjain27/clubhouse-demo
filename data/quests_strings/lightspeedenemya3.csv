LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUESTION,Let's keep working on that Lightspeed enemy you made.,Ada,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_LAUNCH,You know the drill: Launch Lightspeed.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_EXPLANATION,"Now that *spinner* enemy moves in a diagonal and goes off screen. Let's make sure it stays on screen.

Let's go to the coding panel again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE,"Select the spinning enemy and look for the updateSpinner() function.

That's where we keep making y a bit smaller every time. Let's stop doing that when it gets to 0.

We can use an 'if' statement. if (enemy.y > 0) enemy.y = enemy.y - 10;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT1,Prevent y from going below 0 with an if statement. Then run the game.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_PLAYING,Let's see how you did with that.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTMOVING,Something went wrong and now the enemies aren't moving. Go back to the coding panel and let's fix it.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_GOINGDOWN,Hmm... they're still going below the screen. Go back and make sure you don't update the y position if they go below 0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTREACHINGBOTTOM,The enemies aren't quite reaching the bottom of the screen. Check your code again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_SUCCESS,Perfect. Now they aren't going anywhere. Good job. Let's continue with this later.,,,,
