POWERUPB1_QUESTION,Ready to try out another powerup?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sounds fun!,,,,
POWERUPB1_LAUNCH,Excellent. Let's go back to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN,"Let's add a second powerup. Let's create BOTH types of powerups at random.

Let's go in the coding panel and I'll show you how this works. ",,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again and look for the `spawnPowerup()` function.

Right now we're only spawning type 'invulnerable' powerup. 

So, if we want it to be random, how do we set it to spawn type 'invulnerable' or type 'blowup'?

Let's use the `pickOne()` function. Can you guess how it works?",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT1,"If you want to return either one or the other, you use `pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')`.",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT2,"To return `'invulnerable'` or `'blowup'`, you do 'pickOne('invulnerable', 'blowup')'.",,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY_HINT1,Press the *Restart* button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN,How about if we try that again.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAY_AGAIN_HINT1,Click *Restart*.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAYTEST,Here's where we find out if we get both types of powerups.,,,,
POWERUPB1_NOPOWERUPS,Hmm. Now we have no powerups at all. Something went wrong. Let's fix it.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ONETYPEONLY,"We have *some* powerups, but it's only one type. Are both types being spawned?",,,,
POWERUPB1_FINISHLEVEL,That's it! We now have both types. Go ahead and finish the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_SUCCESS,"Splendid. So we have two powerups now, but the second one doesn't yet have its powers. 

What power would you like to add? ",,hurray,,
POWERUPB1_ABORT,No problem. Let's resume work later. ,,,,
