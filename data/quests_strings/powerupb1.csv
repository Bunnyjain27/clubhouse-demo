POWERUPB1_QUESTION,Ready to try out another powerup?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
POWERUPB1_LAUNCH,Excellent. Let's go back to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN,"Let's add a second powerup. For now we want to create BOTH types of powerups at random.

Let's go in the coding panel and I'll show you how this works. So let's take this step by step. ",,,,
POWERUPB1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE,"Click on the Spawn tab again and look for the `spawnPowerup()` function.

Right now we're only spawning type 1 powerup. So, how do we set it to spawn type 1 or type 2?

Let's use the `random()` function we used before. Do you remember how it works?",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT1,"If you do `random(a,b)` it returns a number between a and b.",,,,
POWERUPB1_CODE_HINT2,"So to return 1 or 2, you do `random(1,2)`.",,,,
POWERUPB1_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and play the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if we get both types of powerups.,,,,
POWERUPB1_NOPOWERUPS,Hmm.  Now we have no powerups at all. Something went wrong. Let's fix it.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ONETYPEONLY,"We have some powerups, but it's only one type. Let's go back and use the `random()` function.",,,,
POWERUPB1_FINISHLEVEL,That's it! We now have both types. Go ahead and finish the level.,,,,
POWERUPB1_SUCCESS,Perfect. The second powerup doesn't do anything yet. Come get me at the Clubhouse and we'll fix that.,,,,
POWERUPB1_ABORT,No problem. Let's resume work later. ,,,,
