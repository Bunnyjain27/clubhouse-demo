Launch LightSpeed now, please.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2,"Someone made those asteroids way too big! You'll need to get in there and adjust that. 

Just like before, you'll have to hack the app to fix it. But this time you'll be using code to do it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_GIVEKEY,I'm going to give you the level 2 key for LightSpeed. Remember: With great power comes great responsibility!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_UNLOCK,Now unlock the level 2 panel and let's do some coding.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE,"See the function called spawn_obstacle_code()? That's where we set the scale for the asteroids.

Change the scale to something smaller so the level becomes playable again.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT1,Make sure to play level 3 and beat it to make sure your solution works correctly.,,,
