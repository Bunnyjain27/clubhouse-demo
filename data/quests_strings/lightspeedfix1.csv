LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_QUESTION,Ready for some more coding? ,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sounds good,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_LAUNCH,"You've already seen the Lightspeed game. We'll want you to add more levels, but for now I need you to fix level 3.

Launch Lightspeed now, please.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION,Play level 3 and be on the lookout for anything unusual.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2,"Someone made those asteroids way too big! You'll need to get in there and adjust that. 

Just like before, you'll have to hack the app to fix it. But this time you'll be using code to do it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_GIVEKEY,I'm going to give you the level 2 key for Lightspeed. Remember: With great power comes great responsibility!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_UNLOCK,Now unlock the level 2 panel and let's do some coding.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE,"See the function called spawnEnemy()? That's where we set the scale for the asteroids.

Change the scale to something smaller so the level becomes playable again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT1,See that scale: 150? Change that number to something smaller.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_CODE_HINT2,Make sure to play level 3 and beat it to check your solution works correctly.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABOUTTOPLAY,"OK, let's try it now.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_PLAYTEST,"If all went well, asteroids should be smaller can you can beat this level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_PLAYTEST_HINT1,"If you can't beat it, go back to the code panel and try making it even smaller.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_SUCCESS,Excellent. That'll do it. We've got a few more things to fix. Come find me when you're ready for more coding!,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX1_ABORT,Stop by again sometime soon!,,,,
