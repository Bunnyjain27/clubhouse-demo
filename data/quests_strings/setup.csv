SETUP_QUESTION,Glad to see you! We've got a bit of a situation here. We have to rescue Riley! Can you help us?,Saniel,,,
SETUP_QUESTION_ACCEPT,Definitely! ,,,,
SETUP_EXPLAIN,"So, here's what's going on. Riley's missing and all of us will need to work together to find her. 

She was poking around in a restricted area and suddenly plummeted into some kind of portal!

When I heard the ruckus I got there just as the box closed & caught Riley's scarf.",,,,
SETUP_EXPLAIN2,"I thought this thing was disarmed a thousand blue moons ago. Now it's got Riley! 

This contraption is supposed to capture data threats, not our own Conservatory students!

I hope Riley will find a way to communicate with us! Knowing Riley, she'll figure something out. 

",,,,
SETUP_END,"The box is locked down tight with a triple passcode protocol. 

The codes are embedded on 3 small tags, or ""fobs."" They work like a key, but with radio waves!

For extra security, the fobs are hidden in 3 different levels deep in Fizzics and and in Lightspeed.

Our job is to get to each of those levels and retrieve the coded fobs and open those panels! 

",,,,
SETUP_ABORT,"OK, hope you can come back soon!",,,,
