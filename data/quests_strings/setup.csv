SETUP_QUESTION,Glad to see you! We've got a bit of a situation here. We have to rescue Riley! Can you help us?,Saniel,,,
SETUP_QUESTION_ACCEPT,Definitely! ,,,,
SETUP_EXPLAIN,"So, here's what's going on. Riley's missing and all of us will need to work together to find her. 

She was poking around in a restricted area and suddenly plummeted into some kind of portal!

When I heard the ruckus I got there just as the entry panels closed & caught Riley's scarf.",,,,
SETUP_EXPLAIN2,"Very concerning. I thought this thing was disarmed a thousand blue moons ago. Now it's got Riley! 

This contraption is supposed to capture data threats, not capture our own Conservatory students!

I hope Riley will find a way to communicate with us! Knowing Riley, she'll figure something out. 

Indeed, she's probably already investigating something new in there. Alright, let's get on this.",,,,
SETUP_END,"So, the box is locked down tight with a triple passcode protocol. We need to get those access codes. 

The codes are embedded on 3 small tags, or ""fobs."" They work like a key, but with radio waves!

For extra security, the fobs are hidden in 3 different levels deep in Fizzics and and in Lightspeed.

So our job is to get to each of those levels and retrieve the coded fobs and open those panels! 

",,,,
SETUP_ABORT,"OK, hope you can come back soon!",,,,
