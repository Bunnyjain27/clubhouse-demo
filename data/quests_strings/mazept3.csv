MAZEPT3_RILEYPUSH,"Check out this Push Instruction Estelle told me about! So cool! We can use it to get past this column of walls!

MAZEPT3_RILEYPUSH_HINT1,Click the Flip key.  Type in Riley.Push(),Riley,,,
MAZEPT3_RILEYPUSH2,"Push is exactly the thing for when I’m lined up with a wall and about to crash into it. 
Suddenly I'm so strong I can actually move walls!  Flip the app back over! & let’s give it a try! ",,,,
