KRITACOLORING_QUEST_NAME,Krita - Just My Color,,,,
KRITACOLORING_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITACOLORING_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start with a simple picture, then change its color and add a background. Quick and easy!",,,,
KRITACOLORING_1,"Hi there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've probably done lots of drawing and coloring on paper, but have you ever done it on a computer?",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_2,"Once, professionals had to pay for expensive software to make anything that looked good. Now we have free software like Krita, so everyone can make beautiful works of art!",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_3,"I'll open Krita up for you - but you can find it on the desktop, in the future.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_4,"Once Krita's loaded, look in the center of your screen and click <b>Open File</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_5,"A box should open with a file browser in it. Using that file browser, go to your <b>home</b> directory (it's got your username on it, on the left side of the file browser), then navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>KritaSources</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_6,"In <b>KritaSources</b>, you should find a file called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">calm-and-happy.png</span></tt>. Select that file and open it, and Krita should be showing you a picture of a person meditating.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_7,"This person looks so peaceful, so calm...but that red shirt is kind of intense. Can you think of a calmer color? Hmmm, maybe we can change that.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_8,"At the top right, you should see a colorful ring around a triangle. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_9,"If the ring and triangle are blocked by this text box, you can move it by putting your cursor near the top of my head, and then clicking the downward-pointing arrow that shows up.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_10,"Now that you can see everything, try clicking around inside the ring. Did you see a big square appear next to the circle? Did the color change when you clicked? Now look at the triangle in the middle of the color ring.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_11,See that little circle inside the triangle? Try clicking around inside that triangle. The big square will show up and change color again.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_12,"The circle is where you pick a color, and the triangle lets you choose how light or dark it is. Try different colors and adjust the shade to make them light or dark. (Tip: Dark orange makes brown!)",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_13,"Select the color you want to make the shirt. Find the part of the color ring that's closest, then adjust the shade until that preview square looks just right.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_14,"Now, we need to make sure we've got the right tool for the job. Look on the left side of the screen, a little less than half-way down - We're looking for the icon that looks like a tipping paint bucket, it's called the <b>Fill Tool</b>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_15,"Click that button, and then click the shirt to make it change color!",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_16,"In art software, there are always TONS of ways to add color to your art, usually using different Tools. You can paint it on bit by bit with a Brush, or you can fill in a big area with the Fill Tool.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_17,"Do you like our guy's new look? If not, you can always undo it and select a new color to try again.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_18,"Anytime you click the wrong spot, or you want to undo a change, there are two ways to do it. At the <b>top left</b>, the Undo button has an arrow pointing backward - Or you can press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_19,"If Undo doesn't work, you can always close the project and start over. Choose 'No' when it asks if you want to save your (accidental) changes. Then you can reopen it and start fresh. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_20,"To avoid having to do that, though, you should save your work! Let's do that now - Open the <b>File</b> menu, up at the top, and select <b>Save As...</b>. Name the file whatever you like, and then click <b>Save</b>. If another dialogue shows up, just click <b>OK</b>, it's not important to us right now.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_21,"Now, our friend here looks pretty darn chill. But what's with that weird checkerboard pattern in the background?",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_22,"That checkerboard is how the computer tells us that the background is ""transparent"". The computer can't show us a see-through background (What would that even look like?), so instead it shows us a checkerboard to let us know it's transparent.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_23,"Now, since the are around our guy is <b>transparent</b>, you can put this picture on top of anything you want, and you won't have any awkward square around it. You'll just see a happy, chill dude sitting on top of....whatever.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_24,"It might be a little hard to see how this works, so let's test it out. Don't forget to Save first, though! (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>)",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_25,"You never know when you might lose power, or have your computer crash, anything could happen. As soon as you make any significant changes to a project, always Save. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_26,You think I'm being paranoid? I don't think you'd want to lose an hour and a half of work because your cat walked across your keyboard...,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_27,"Anyway! Look over there on the right, near the middle. There's a little tab label that says 'Layers.' A Layer is like a transparent, clear sheet of paper. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_28,You can draw stuff on different ones and stack them together to make all the parts look like one big picture.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_29,"Right now, there's only one Layer, called Layer 1. We're going to make a new one.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_30,"Click the plus symbol inside a square, at the bottom of the <b>Layers</b> section.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_31,"Now, the new Layer is on top of the old one, like we laid down a transparent sheet on top of our picture. But we want to make a background, not cover up our meditating friend.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_32,"Drag Layer 2 to the other side of Layer 1. You may want to rename it as 'Layer 0' or 'Background.' If so, double-click on the layer name and type in the new one.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_33,"Before we try to draw on this new layer, we need to have it selected - click on it so that it turns blue. Now we could use the brush tool or the Fill Tool, but it'll go faster with Fill.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_34,"Choose a lovely, calming shade of...whatever, make sure you're using the Fill Tool, and click anywhere that's empty. You might need to click again between the arm and knee.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_35,"Doesn't it look lovely? You can do all kinds of stuff with layers. You could make clouds and grass here, add some polka dots, or anything else! The best part is not having to worry about drawing over your main character by accident.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_36,"We'll learn more about what you can add next time, and how to ""photoshop"" decorations onto your photos.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_37,"In the meantime, you can try customizing an image of your favorite cartoon character. Just download an image from the internet, open it in Krita and use the Fill Tool. See what they look like with dyed green hair, or hot pink clothes.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_38,See you soon!,daemon2,,,
