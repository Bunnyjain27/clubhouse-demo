KRITACOLORING_QUEST_NAME,Krita - Just My Color,,,,
KRITACOLORING_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
KRITACOLORING_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Start with a simple picture, then change its color and add a background. Quick and easy!",,,,
KRITACOLORING_1,"Hi there, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've probably done lots of drawing and coloring on paper, but have you ever done it on a computer?",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_2,Lots of professional artists use computers to make their best art. Today you'll learn some of their tricks!,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_3,"Once, professionals had to pay for expensive software to make anything that looked good. Now we have free software like Krita, so everyone can make beautiful works of art!",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_4,"I'll open Krita up for you - but you can find it on the desktop, in the future.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_5,"Once Krita's loaded, click <b>Open File</b> and navigate into your <b>Pictures</b> folder, then into <b>KritaSources</b>, where you should find a file called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">calm-and-happy.png</span></tt>",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_6,"Select that file and open it, and Krita should be showing you a picture of a person meditating.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_7,"This person looks so peaceful, so calm...but that red shirt is kind of intense. Can you think of a calmer color? Hmmm, maybe we can change that.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_8,"At the top right, you should see a colorful ring around a triangle. Try clicking around inside the ring.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_9,Did you see a big square appear next to the circle? Did the color change when you clicked? Now look at the triangle in the middle of the color ring.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_10,See that little circle inside the triangle? Try clicking around inside that triangle. The big square will show up and change color again.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_11,"The circle is where you pick a color, and the triangle lets you choose how light or dark it is. Try different colors and adjust the shade to make them light or dark. (Tip: Dark orange makes brown!)",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_12,"Now select the color you want to make the shirt. Find the part of the color ring that's closest, then adjust the shade until that preview square looks just right.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_13,Now click on the shirt to make it change color!,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_14,"Oops, looks like we just make a polka dot. Heh, sorry! I forgot we had the paintbrush tool selected.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_15,"There are LOTS of different tools in Krita. That paintbrush might come in handy for drawing later, but right now we need the Fill Tool. This won't put color in just one spot, it'll fill in a whole area!",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_16,See if you can find it on the left. This one looks like a big can of paint just starting to spill.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_17,Need a hint? The Paint Bucket is on a row all by itself. Click on it to select it.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_18,"In art software, there are always TONS of ways to add color to your art, usually using different Tools. You can paint it on bit by bit with a Brush, or you can fill in a big area with the Fill Tool.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_19,"Okay, so you've got your color selected and you're ready to put it down with the Fill Tool. Go ahead and click on that red shirt.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_20,"Do you like the look? If not, you can always undo it and select a new color to try again.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_21,"Anytime you click the wrong spot, or you want to undo a change, there are two ways to do it. At the <b>top left</b>, the Undo button has an arrow pointing backward - Or you can press <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + Z</span></tt>.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_22,"If you accidentally hit something REALLY weird and Undo doesn't work...Well, you can always close the project. Choose 'No' when it asks if you want to save your (accidental) changes. Then you can reopen it and start fresh. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_23,"You really should save your work as you go, though. <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Ctrl + S</span></tt>!",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_24,"Now, our friend here looks pretty darn chill. But what's with that weird checkerboard pattern in the background?",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_25,"That is how the computer tells us that the background is ""transparent"". ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_26,The computer can't show us a see-through background. What would that even look like? So instead it shows us a checkerboard to let us know it's transparent.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_27,"Now, since this picture is <b>transparent</b>, you can put this picture on top of anything you want, and you won't have any awkward square around it. You'll just see a happy, chill dude sitting on top of....whatever.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_28,"All right, fine. I can see why it's kind of hard to believe that looking at.....well, checkerboard. Okay, I'll show you something cool, and then you can test it out. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_29,"Oh, but you should save first! You never know when you might lose power, or have your computer crash....Anything could happen. So as soon as you make any changes to a project, always Save. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_30,And then Save again for each of the significant changes you make.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_31,"You think I'm being paranoid? Well, you'll be sorry if you lose an hour and a half's work because something random happens, like your cat walking across your keyboard...",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_32,"Anyway! Look over there on the right, near the middle. There's a little tab label that says 'Layers.' A Layer is like a transparent, clear sheet of paper. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_33,You can draw stuff on different ones and stack them together to make all the parts look like one big picture.,daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_34,"Right now, there's only one Layer, called Layer 1. We're going to make a new one.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_35,"Click the plus symbol inside a square, just underneath the Layers. ",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_36,"You can name the new layer whatever you want, or you can just leave it as 'Layer 2'.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_37,"Now, the new Layer is on top of the old one, like we laid down a transparent sheet on top of our picture. But we want to make a background, not cover up our meditating friend.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_38,"Drag Layer 2 (or whatever you named it) to the other side of Layer 1. You may want to rename it as 'Layer 0' or 'Background.' If so, right-click on the layer and select Rename.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_39,"Before we try to draw on this new layer, we need to have it selected - click on it so that it turns blue. Now we could use the brush tool or the Fill Tool, but it'll go faster with Fill.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_40,"Choose a lovely, calming shade of...whatever, then select the Fill Tool, and click anywhere that's empty. You might need to click again between the arm and knee.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_41,"Doesn't it look lovely? You can do all kinds of stuff with layers. You could make clouds and grass here, add some polka dots, or anything else! The best part is not having to worry about drawing over your main character by accident.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_42,"We'll learn more about what you can add next time, and how to ""photoshop"" decorations onto your photos.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_43,"In the meantime, you can try customizing an image of your favorite cartoon character. Just download an image from the internet, open it in Krita and use the Fill Tool. See what they look like with dyed green hair, or hot pink clothes.",daemon2,,,
KRITACOLORING_44,See you soon!,daemon2,,,
