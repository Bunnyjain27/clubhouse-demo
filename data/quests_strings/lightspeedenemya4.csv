LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_QUESTION,Let's do one last change to that new enemy.,Ada,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_LAUNCH,Let's go to LightSpeed... Engage!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_EXPLANATION,"The enemies now move in the diagonal and accumulate at the bottom of the screen. Let's make it more interesting.

They should now bounce off the bottom of the screen and start moving up. Let's go to the coding panel.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE,"We know when they hit the bottom of the screen because y is 0 or less. But how do we change direction?

Let's use the velocity of the enemy. We can start with a velocity of -10 and when we hit bottom, we change it to +10.

Then we just add the velocity to the position every time: enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + enemy.velocity.y;",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE_HINT1,Check if we go below and change the direction of the velocity: if (enemy.position.y <= 0) velocity.y = -velocity.y;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_PLAYING,Let's see if they bounce now...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_NOTMOVING,Now they aren't moving up and down at all. That's probably because we never set the initial speed. Go back to the code.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_GOINGUNDER,TODO: Going under,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_GOINGOVER,That's good! However... now they go off the top of the screen. Let's fix that while we're at it. Go back to the code.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2,"OK, we need to do a very similar check for going off the top. The top of the screen is in the variable height.

So you can set up an if statement for the position going over height and flipping the velocity.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2_HINT1,The if statement is very similar: if (enemy.position.y >= height) ...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2_HINT2,if (enemy.position.y >= height) velocity.y = -velocity.y;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2_HINT3,And don't forget you still need to update the position: enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + enemy.velocity.y;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2_HINT4,Go ahead and play the level whenever you think you're ready.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE3,Find the enemy_spawn() function and set an initial velocity.y of -10.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE3_HINT1,Include velocity.y: -10;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE3_HINT2,Or if you want to make it more challenging you can use a random vertical velocity.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE3_HINT3,"Something like velocity.y: random(-10,10);",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_SUCCESS,"Great! Now they bounce up and down and always stay in the screen. 

By the way, you said earlier you were looking for XXXXX. I have one of those here.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_END,"Here, take it. You can have it. You did a great job. See you around.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_ABORT,Abort,,,
