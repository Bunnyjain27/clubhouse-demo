LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUESTION,We've got our work cut out for us on Lightspeed.,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Let's do it,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_LAUNCH,All right. Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_EXPLANATION,"Level 4 was left rather sparse. We need some more asteroids!

Go ahead and flip to hack just as we did before.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"There. See the spawnEnemy() function? Someone left it empty. No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try adding return ""asteroid""; and running level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the spawnEnemy() function gets called every frame (about 30 times per second!).

So you're creating 30 asteroids per second! Let's go back and fix it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_NOENEMIES,"No, I don't see any enemies yet. Let's go back and look at the spawn code again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"What we want is more like an asteroid every second.

Notice that we have the variable tick, which goes up once every frame. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

We know 30 ticks have passed when tick mod 30 is 0 (when tick is a multiple of 30). In code it's tick%30.

And we can use an if statement to tie it all together: if (condition) return ""asteroid""; return null;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT1,The condition would be tick%50.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT2,"if (tick%50) return ""asteroid""; return null;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_SUCCESS,Smart work there! Clearly you're ready for something more challenging. Ada will give you the details. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
