LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUESTION,We've got our work cut out for us on Lightspeed.,Saniel,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, let's get on it!",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_LAUNCH,All right. Let's go to Lightspeed again.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_EXPLANATION,"Level 4 is looking quite sparse! We need some more asteroids!

Go ahead and flip to hack just as we did before.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"Click on the game tab again. The spawnEnemy() function is returning null! No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try changing it to return ""asteroid""; and running Level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT1,"Don't forget the double quotes around ""asteroid"" and the semicolon at the end.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE_HINT2,"When it looks good, press the Flip button again and try your level.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Go ahead and test your code by playing Level 4.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_PLAYTEST,Let's see those asteroids now.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the spawnEnemy() function gets called every frame (about 30 times per second!).

So you're creating 30 asteroids per second! Let's go back and fix it.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_NOENEMIES,"No, I don't see any enemies yet. Let's go back and look at the spawn code again.",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"An asteroid every second would be more like what we want.

We have a variable called tick, which goes up once every frame. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

We know 30 ticks have passed when tick mod 30 is 0 (when tick is a multiple of 30). In code it's tick%30.

And we can use an if statement to tie it all together: if (condition) return ""asteroid""; return null;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT1,The condition would be tick%30==0.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT2,"if (tick%30==0) return ""asteroid""; return null;",,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2_HINT3,Go back to the game when you're ready and test it out.,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_SUCCESS,Smart work there! Clearly you're ready for something more challenging. Ada will give you the details. ,,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Done so soon? Come back to the Clubhouse whenever you want to try again.,,,,
