INSPECTOR2_QUEST_NAME,The Inspector Becomes The Inspected,,,,
INSPECTOR2_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
INSPECTOR2_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Ada shows you some more cool tricks for the Inspector! (Part 2),,,,
INSPECTOR2_1,"Hello again, *{{user_name}}*. Ready to do some more webpage hacking with the Inspector?",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_2,"Let's dive right in - I'll launch your browser, just point it to http://hack-computer.com, then open that Inspector gadget (Ctrl + Shift + I).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_3,"Here we are again! Activate the *Select Element* button in the *top left corner of the Inspector*. Remember, it looks like an arrow pointing at a box.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_4,"Click on any of the images in the page, and notice that the Inspector will highlight the line that adds that image to the page. It should start with `<img...` and then at some point later in the tag, it should have  `src=""...""` - you can read that as ""source"".",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_5,"Let's replace that image. To do that, we need to change the address inside the `src=""...""` part of the tag to a different 'source' address.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_6,"In the Inspector, double-click on the `src` text - be careful not to click the link to the actual image. Hit delete to erase the text, and then replace it with http://bit.ly/happycat1 (Press `Enter` when you're done).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_7,"Perfect. Hey, Felix, come check out what *{{user_name}}* just did!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_8,"_Prrrowrrr, nyan!_
`<Felix looks pleased.>`",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_9,I knew he'd like it. The approval of a cat is always a good thing to have.,ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_10,"Let's try something you might already know, but from a different angle. Use the *Element Selector* to select “We're teaching a mindset."" (The popup over the text when you mouse over it should say `span`). How you could make that text orange? If you have an idea, give it a try!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_11,"Here's how I'd do it - Once you've selected that text using the *Element Selector*, look in the Inspector pane, at the highlighted text.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_12,"I definitely recognize some of the code in there, `style=...` should look famillar. Let's change the color to `color:orange;`.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_13,"What you're doing is changing the page code behind the scenes - you're rewriting the webpage on the fly! Try changing that color to a hex color, like `#76EECF`. ",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_14,"Nice work! You can do that with text in any webpage - Who knows, maybe someone hid some text by making it the same color as the background.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_15,"Next, let’s try hacking a link. Try finding a link using the *Element Selector*. Remember, a link can be attached to text, buttons, images, videos, almost anything.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_16,"If you're having trouble finding a link, try selecting one of the ""Get Now"" buttons (not the text in the button, the button itself).",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_17,"When you've found a link and selected it with the *Element Selector*, the Inspector should highlight some code that starts with `<a...` What we want is the `href=""...""` part of the tag, which controls where the link goes.",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_18,"When you've found it, double-click the text in between the quotes in the `href=""...""` part, and replace it with http://www.nyan.cat",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_19,"OK, now you can close the Inspector. Let's test your hacked link, see you on the other side!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_20,"See, Felix? I told you that *{{user_name}}* knew what you liked!",ada,,,
INSPECTOR2_21,"_Brbrbrbr..._
`<Felix puffs himself up and purrs quietly.>`",felixnet,,,
INSPECTOR2_22,"Well, looks like you scored 10/10 in Felix's book, *{{user_name}}*. I'd say that's a _purrrfect_ score. `::>^_^<::` See you later!",ada,,,
