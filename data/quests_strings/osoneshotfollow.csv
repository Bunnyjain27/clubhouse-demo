OSONESHOTFOLLOW_QUEST_NAME,The Command-line - Follow the Trail,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Learn to follow a map through your computer's file system and move files. (Part 3 of 4),,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_LAUNCH,"Run the Terminal from the desktop, and let's roll out!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited - We're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,"If you're not in `yarnbasket`, let's get back in there, type `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Let's look at your results from last time - if you forgot the file you saved, type `ls` and try to find it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,Now you can `cat results` (or whatever you named your file).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"Like I said last time, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_6,"I'll let you in on a cool trick you can use to travel through lots of directories at once. Normally, you'd just type `cd first`, `cd second`, and so on. But!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_7,There's a faster way. You can type `cd all/those/directories/in/a/row`. Give it a shot!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_8,Is... that a message in the directory names? Wierd! I wonder what it means?,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_9,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,Is that a file named `treasure`? Haha! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,Let's investigate! `cat treasure.jpg`!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_13,"Oh, right. I feel a little dumb right now - this is a `jpg` file, which is an image. You can't get anything out of one of these by using `cat`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_14,"Well, let's move this file to a place where we can look at it more easily - like your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_15,"To move a file, we need to use the *move* command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_16,"To use `mv` to move this file, it needs the file you want to move, and where you want it to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_17,"So, that's `mv treasure.jpg âˆ¼/Pictures/`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_18,"Nice. Now the file should be in your *Pictures* folder, inside your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_19,"If you want, you can open the file manager program (*Documents* on your Desktop) and go see that the file is there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_20,"BTW, if you're wondering how I know all these commands and how to use them, well, it's because I've got a reference.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_21,"I actually wrote it myself! If you want to see it, I dropped it in your *Documents* folder - it's called `rileysreference.txt`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_22,"Remember, if you need to read a text file in the Terminal, you can use `cat`!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_END,Whew. I think that's enough for the moment! I have something special for your final adventure - check back with me soon!,riley,,,
