FIZZICSCODE1_QUESTION,Ready to do some real coding?,Ada,,
FIZZICSCODE1_ANSWER,Sounds great,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_LAUNCH,We're going to do some coding in Fizzics. Go ahead and launch it.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Click on the Fizzics icon on the desktop.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_FLIP,Now click on the Flip to Hack button to get to the hacking panel. You know the drill.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_FLIP_HINT1,Click the Flip to Hack button on the left of the screen.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_UNLOCK,"You've seen this before, but now we're going to go deeper. Click on the lock screen to unlock the code section.",,,
FIZZICSCODE1_UNLOCK_HINT1,Click on the lock.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION1,"Here we are! Coding takes some practice, but it's very powerful. Let's check it out.

The coding panel shows all the variables involved in Fizzics. It's another way of showing what you see in the user interface.

Try changing the radius for species 0 clicking on the + button. See how the code changes to reflect that?",,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION1_HINT1,Change the radius for the orange ball pressing on the + button next to Radius.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION2,Great. Now go in the coding panel and change that radius variable to something different. You'll see it change in the user interface too.,,,
FIZZICSCODE1_EXPLANATION2_HINT1,"In the coding panel, change the value of the variable species[0].radius.",,,
FIZZICSCODE1_END,"You're getting the hang of it. The parameters for each species are in an array: species[0], species[1], etc.

Feel free to change any value and see how they behave. And rememer you always have the reset button if you need it.

I need to go. We're still investigating what happened to my research. Bye!",,,
FIZZICSCODE1_ABORT,We can continue later.,,,
