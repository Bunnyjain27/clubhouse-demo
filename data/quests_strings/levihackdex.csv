LEVIHACKDEX_DUMMY3,"hackdex dummy text 3, even longer still, also the end (If you see this in master it's a bug!)",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_QUESTION,"Hey there, Would you like to see what's in these files? ",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes! ,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_LAUNCH,The files should be there on the desktop - Launch the *Leviathan* app.,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO,"Whew. so glad to see –– wait, all the text is encrypted. Finally got these back and now I can't read them!

These files hold some of my research on a mysterious historical hacker Leviathan. 

*Document 1103* covers Leviathan's takedown of an especially wily AI. But to read it, we need to decrypt it!",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO1,Maybe Estelle can help us with this. She is a total genius with ciphers.,Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO2,Did I hear that someone is having trouble with a cipher?,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO3,"Estelle! That was fast even for you. Thank you for responding so quickly. 

We need your eyes on this. Something tells me you'll be able to decipher it. ",Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO4,Let's see. Mmm hmm. I think I can move this along. I've done a bit of this in my day.,Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PREFLIP,Let's see what the trouble is. Maybe we can get in there adjust some settings in the hacking panel. ,Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_GIVEKEY,Try this key and see if it gets us where we need to go.  ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_UNLOCK,"Ah, beautiful. ",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT,So here we are. See that number labelled cipher? Let's try changing that and see what happens. ,Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_HINT1,Try any number. Even the wrong guess will give us more information about what we're working with. ,Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_ONE,"Aha. You can check one of the documents to see what it did, but this confirms for me that this is indeed a rotational cipher. 

Meaning, the letters are shifted over in the alphabet. The number tells us how many spaces the letters have shifted. 

For example. if you take a simple word, like, CAT, and shift all the letters over one, you get, DBU. ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_TWO,"Maybe the page holds some clues? What can we still see clearly? Just for fun, try counting the cat tails! ",,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_DECRYPT_SUCCESS,Excellent! That did the trick! Look at all these files. ,Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_BACKGROUND,"Hey, check out that sketch at the bottom right. I was wondering if that might be useful. ",Ada,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION,"Ah yes. Here we are. What we’re looking at is a *Sidetrack* *Instruction*  called `push`.

Now that's a signature Leviathan move. Removing an obstacle. ",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,"Tiiiight! I knew you'd be able to help us with this, Estelle! Thank you!",Faber,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,"Amazing. Thank you, Estelle. I remember seeing that *Instruction* in Leviathan's notes. What does it do?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION4,"It does just what it says. You can use it to move a *Wall* that's blocking you. 

Riley can use it in the maze to push *Walls* out of her way. It’s going to be essential in getting her past this obstacle. ",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION5,"Well, this is getting very interesting! Why was there a note about Saniel's trap in Leviathan's code sketchbooks?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION6,"Ada, I think that's something you're going to have to ask Saniel about! ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_SUCCESS,"I am totally going to do that. Right now, we've got to get back to Riley!

Let’s go back to *Sidetrack* and see if we can help her with this new *Instruction*. ",Ada,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_ABORT,"Okay, come back when you're ready! Riley still needs our help to get through the maze, so come back soon!",Ada,,,
