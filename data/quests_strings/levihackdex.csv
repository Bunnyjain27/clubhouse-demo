LEVIHACKDEX_QUESTION,"Hey there, Would you like to see what's in these files? ",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes! ,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_LAUNCH,The files should be there on the dektop - Launch the *Leviathan* app.,Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO,"Whew. so glad to see these! You’ve heard about Leviathan, right? We’re all Leviathan fans around here.  

These files hold some of my research on Leviathan. So let’s see what we have here.",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO1,"Wait, what’s going on? This is illegible. Everything’s scrambled. 

Finally got these back and now my own encryption has been scrambled!

Maybe Estelle can help us with this. She is a total genius with ciphers.",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO2,"Hello Estelle! Thank you so much for getting here so quickly! 

We need your eyes on this. Something tells me you'll be able to decipher it. ",Faber,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_OPENINTRO3,"Let's see. Mmm hmm.  think I can move this along. I've done a bit of this in my day. 

I see you’ve been keeping a dossier on Leviathan! I know a bit about this illustrious figure myself. ",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_GIVEKEY,"
First thing we’ll need is this key. hmmm, 
",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_BACKGROUND,I think of Leviathan as ancestor! I'm always digging up whatever I can about him. ,Ada,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION,"Ah yes. This is a signature Leviathan move. Removing an obstacle. 

What we’re looking at is a *Sidetrack* Instruction called `push`.",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION2,"Tight! I knew you'd be able to help us with this, Estelle! Thank you!",Faber,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION3,"Amazing. Thank you, Estelle. I remember seeing that in Leviathan's notes.

I just couldn't figure out what it was. What does it do?",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION4,"It does just what it says. You can use it to move a *Wall* that's blocking you. 

Riley can use it in the maze to push *Walls* out of her way. 

It’s going to be essential in getting her past this obstacle. ",Estelle,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION5,"Well, this is getting very interesting! 

Why was there a note about Saniel's trap in Leviathan's code sketchbooks?
",Ada,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_PUSHINSTRUCTION6,"Ada, I think that's something you're going to have to ask Saniel about! ",Estelle,,,
LEVIHACKDEX_SUCCESS,"I am totally going to do that. Right now, we've got to get back to Riley!

Let’s go back to *Sidetrack* and see if we can help her with this new Instruction. ",Ada,,,quests/teaching
LEVIHACKDEX_ABORT,"Okay, come back when you're ready! Riley still needs our help to get through the maze, so come back soon!",Ada,,,
