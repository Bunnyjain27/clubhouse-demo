MAKERINTRO_STEALTHQUESTION,"What exactly is a Steath Device, Faber?",Riley,,,
MAKERINTRO_STEALTHEXPLANATION,"A Stealth Device lets you go anywhere undetected. Not that you'd ever want something like that, Riley! 

I once glimpsed some schematics of one of these deflectors! 

Rumors have it that the legendary hacker Leviathan used a device like this one in his exploits. 
",,,,
MAKERINTRO_THANKS,"Let me get this right. A device that lets us go anywhere undetected? Fascinating. Fascinating. 

We just might have a use for that! Purely for research purposes of course. ʌ˽ʌ Thanks Faber! You rule. ",Riley,,,
