See if you can find a way to solve this. Go ahead and launch Fizzics.",,,,quests/faber-theme

MAKERINTRO_WHATISIT,"Hey Faber, since we're here, do you have any clue what this weird rusty thingamajig might be?",Riley,,,
MAKERINTRO_GIVEITEM,"Hmmm, let me see. Let me immerse it in this clarifying solution. 

Whoa, look at that! This stuff really works! Hold up! Riley, I think this is part of a Stealth Device! 

I can't believe you found this! This is so major. Totally cool to actually hold one in my hands!

MAKERINTRO_STEALTHQUESTION,"What exactly is a Steath Device, Faber?",Riley,,,
MAKERINTRO_STEALTHEXPLANATION,"A Stealth Device lets you go anywhere undetected. Not that you'd ever want something like that, Riley! 

I once glimpsed some schematics of a device like this. 

Rumors have it that the legendary hacker Leviathan used a device like this one in his exploits. 
",,,,
MAKERINTRO_THANKS,"Let me get this right. A device that lets us go anywhere undetected? Fascinating. Fascinating. 

We just might have a use for that! Purely for research purposes of course. ʌ˽ʌ Thanks Faber! You rule. ",Riley,,,
