POWERUPB2_QUESTION,Ready to make the last powerup light up some real fireworks?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,You bet!,,,,
POWERUPB2_LAUNCH,"OK, launch Lightspeed.",,,,
POWERUPB2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to add code so powerup of type 2 blows up every enemy on the screen.

Click on the Flip button",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE,"This is very similar to the other one. Click on the Powerups tab. See the `handlePowerup()` function?

Right now, if we pick up a powerup of type 1, we turn the ship invulnerable.

We want to add that if we pick up a different kind of powerup, we blow everything up.

See how there's a `if (powerupType == 1)` check already. Add a similar one checking for powerup 2.

Then blow up everything with the funciton `blowUpEnemies()`.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT1,"So after the code that's there already, you should have `if (powerupType == 2)`",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT2,And then `blowUpEnemies();`. And that should do it. Test it out.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level to test it.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAYTEST,Let's see what happens when you pick both kinds of powerups...,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE,All powerups seem to be doing the same thing. Go back and make sure we have the two `if` statements.,,,,
POWERUPB2_FINISHLEVEL,That's some real fireworks! Finish the level now. The powerups will make it much easier.,,,,
POWERUPB2_SUCCESS,Excellent. We have one more powerup to do before we can get the code. ,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
