POWERUPB2_QUESTION,Ready to make the last powerup light up some real fireworks?,Saniel,,,
POWERUPB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,You bet!,,,,
POWERUPB2_LAUNCH,"OK, launch Lightspeed.",,,,
POWERUPB2_EXPLAIN,"We're going to add code so powerup of type 2 blows up every enemy on the screen.

Click on the Flip button",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE,"This is very similar to the other one. Click on the Powerups tab. See the `handlePowerup()` function?

Right now, if we pick up a powerup of type 1, we turn the ship invulnerable.

Now we want to add a setting that if we pick up a different kind of powerup, we blow everything up.

See how there's an `if (powerupType == 1)` check already. Add a similar one for powerup 2.

Then blow up everything with the function `blowUpEnemies()`.",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT1,"So after the code that's there already, you should have `if (powerupType == 2)`",,,,
POWERUPB2_CODE_HINT2,And then `blowUpEnemies();`. And that should do it. Test it out.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ABOUTTOPLAY,Play the level to test it.,,,,
POWERUPB2_PLAYTEST,Let's see what happens when you pick up both kinds of powerups.,,,,
POWERUPB2_ONLYONE,All powerups seem to be doing the same thing. Go back and make sure we have the two `if` statements.,,,,
POWERUPB2_FINISHLEVEL,Major fireworks! Go ahead and finish the level now with the help of the powerups!,,,,
POWERUPB2_SUCCESS,"Excellent. Okay, only one more powerup before we can get our next fob to open the box. ",,,,
POWERUPB2_ABORT,"No problem, we can try it again later. ",,,,
