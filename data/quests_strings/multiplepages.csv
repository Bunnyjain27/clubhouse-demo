MULTIPLEPAGES_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"In this activity, you'll upgrade your single page website to a multi-page website!",,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_QUIT,See you later!,,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've mastered how to build your first web page, but most websites have multiple pages. For example, you might have ""About Me"", ""Projects"", ""Products"", or other pages, to give visitors more information.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_2,"Let's get started. I've added the files we're going to use to your <b>home</b> directory, under <b>/Documents/multiplepages</b>. Let's take a look at them.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_3,"The folder should contain the <b>about.html</b>, <b>contact.html</b>, <b>favs.html</b>, <b>index.html</b> files and three folders: <b>css</b>, <b>images</b>, and <b>js</b>.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_4,"Let's take a look at the page we'll be using in this part of the activity- <b>right-click</b> on the <b>index.html</b> file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_5,The Chrome browser should launch with your web page. The web page should look familiar because it was built using the same components in the previous Bootstrap activity.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_6,"At the top of the page, try clicking on the <b>About Me</b>, <b>My Favorite Things</b>, and <b>Contact Me</b> links in the navigation bar. You'l see pretty quickly that they don't do anything! Let's fix that.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_7,Switch back to your view of the <b>multiplepages</b> folder - we need to open some more files.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_8,"Right-click on the <b>index.html</b> file and select <b>Open With Other Application</b>. In the popup window, if you see <b>Sublime Text</b> highlighted in your Recommended Applications, click the <b>Select</b> button. Otherwise, click the <b>View All Applications</b>, then <b>Sublime Text</b>, and the <b>Select</b> button.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_9,Sublime Text will open and display the code for your page. Take a moment to look over the code. Don't worry if you can't see the problem right away!,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_10,"The location that a link goes to in HTML is defined with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href =</span></tt>. Look at <b>line 25</b> of this file - The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href</span></tt> on that line doesn't have a location right now!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_11,"From the text on that line, you can see that the link should be pointing at <b>index.html</b>. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">index.html</span></tt> between the quotation marks, and your link should now look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href=""index.html""</span></tt>",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_12,"Check out the tab for your file near the top of the Sublime Text window - Notice that there is now a dot on the tab? The dot tells you that you have some unsaved changes. Unsaved changes will not be shown on your webpage, so let's save this file. ",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_13,"Press <b>ctrl + s</b> to save the file with your changes. You'll know the file saved when the dot mark in the tab is replaced with a cross mark (x).  Now, each time you click the Home link, it'll link to the actual page!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_14,"Next, let's check out the link on on line 32. Do you notice something missing? You guessed it - the link to this file is missing, too.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_15,This one should link to <b>about.html</b>. Don't forget to save your changes by hitting <b>ctrl + s</b>. ,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_16,"Next, check line 39, and point that link to the favorites file: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">favs.html</span></tt>.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_17,"Finally let's fix line 46 - it should link to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">contact.html</span></tt>. One last save, and then we can check your work!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_18,"Go back to Chrome and refresh the page, then try out your links! Don't forget to hit <b>back</b> each time after you check one - we've only been changing the links on <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">index.html</span></tt>, not the other pages.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_19,"Don't forget to save index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt>! Now you can <b>Alt + Tab</b> back to Chrome and refresh the page to see your changes.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_20,"Way to go! You've just learned the basics of linking different pages to your website. There are other links for your index page you can fix, such as the cards on <b>lines 106, 120, 134</b>, and the footer on <b>lines 155, 162, 169, and 176</b>. Simply use what you've learned above. That's it!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_21,"You can also fix the links for your other pages such as the About Me, My Favorite Things, and Contact Me pages. Remember, these pages are individual files, so you have to update the links for each page.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_22,Your site's looking good! I think Felix would agree when I say that your practice is going to make... purrfect!,riley,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_23,<i>Mrr#%ow!</i>,felixnet,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_24,"And, of course, you can always personalize your website by changing the text and images to whatever you want. Have fun!",daemon,,,
