MULTIPLEPAGES_NOTINSTALLED,"""Uh-oh! Looks like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt> isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center because we'll be using it for this activity.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, then search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt>, and install it. """,,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! You've mastered how to build your first web page, but most websites have multiple pages. For example, you might have ""About Me"", ""Projects"", ""Products"", or other pages, to give visitors more information.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_2,Let's get started. We've added the files you're going to use in your <b>Documents</b> folder - let's take a look at them.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_3,The <b>lower-left</b> corner of the screen with the icons is called the <b>taskbar</b>. Click the <b>yellow folder</b> icon to launch the <b>File Explorer</b>.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_4,"Once you have the <b>File Explorer</b> open, click the <b>Documents</b> link on the left panel of the window, and then open the <b>multiplepages</b> folder.",,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_5,"The folder should contain the <b>about.html</b>, <b>contact.html</b>, <b>favs.html</b>, <b>index.html</b> files and three folders: <b>css</b>, <b>images</b>, and <b>js</b>. The <b>index</b>, <b>about</b>, <b>contact</b>, and <b>favs</b> files are all different pages for your website. If you ever need a refresher of the file names, come back here.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_6,"Let's take a look at the page we'll be using in this part of the activity- <b>right-click</b> on the <b>index.html</b> file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>. (If you're using a Hack laptop, you can click the mouse pad with two fingers to <b>right-click</b>.)",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_7,The Chrome browser should launch with your web page. The web page should look familiar because it was built using the same components in the previous Bootstrap activity.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_8,"At the top of the page, try clicking on the <b>About Me</b>, <b>My Favorite Things</b>, and <b>Contact Me</b> links in the navigation bar. You'l see pretty quickly that they don't do anything! Let's fix that.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_9,You can do it!,ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_10,Switch back to your File Explorer by pressing <b>Alt + Tab</b>. We need to look at the files in the <b>multiplepages</b> folder again.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_11,"Right-click on the <b>index.html</b> file and select <b>Open With Other Application</b>. In the popup window, if you see <b>Sublime Text</b> highlighted in your Recommended Applications, click the <b>Select</b> button. Otherwise, click the <b>View All Applications</b>, then <b>Sublime Text</b>, and the <b>Select</b> button.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_12,"Here's a quick tip: If you need to resize a window, like Sublime Text, hit the <b>windows button + arrow left</b> to snap it to the left. If you press the <b>windows button + arrow right</b>, the window will snap to the right.",ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_13,"Sublime Text will open and display the code for your page. Take a moment to look over the code. Don't worry if you can't find the problem yet, we'll walk you through it. :)",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_14,"HTML links are defined with the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;a&gt;</span></tt> tag, and the link destination is specified with <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href</span></tt>. Look at <b>line 25</b> of this file - The <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">href</span></tt> on that line doesn't have a location right now! The link should appear within the quotation marks.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_15,"Let's tell the link to point to the <b>index.html</b> file in this folder. Type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">index.html</span></tt> between the quotation marks. Your link should now look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;a href=""index.html""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_16,"Check out the tab for your file near the top of the Sublime Text window - Notice that there is now a dot on the tab? The dot tells you that you have some unsaved changes. Unsaved changes will not be shown on your webpage, so let's save this file. ",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_17,"Press <b>ctrl + s</b> to save the file with your changes. You'll know the file saved when the dot mark in the tab is replaced with a cross mark (x).  Now, each time you hit the Home link, the index.html file will load. ",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_18,"We could test this out, but you wouldn't see anything - Clicking on a link to <b>index.html</b> when we're already at <b>index.html</b> wouldn't do anything! Let's fix the next link in the navigation bar, instead.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_19,Press <b>Alt + Tab</b> to go back to Sublime Text and check out the <b>href</b> link on line 32. Do you notice something missing? You guessed it - the link to the file is missing. Let's fix that.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_20,"Type in the following between the quotation marks: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">about.html</span></tt> Notice that there is now a dot at the tab for your index.html file in Sublime Text.

MULTIPLEPAGES_30,One final bit left to go! The text in the cards at the bottom is blue because they're all links - let's fix that by linking our own <b>style sheet</b> on <b>line 12</b>.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_31,"In between the quotation marks on <b>line 12</b>, type in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">css/style.css</span></tt> The line should look like this: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""css/style.css""&gt;</span></tt>",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_32,"Don't forget to save index.html file by hitting <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ctrl + s</span></tt>! Now you can <b>Alt + Tab</b> back to Chrome and refresh the page to see your changes.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_33,"Way to go! You've just learned the basics of linking different pages to your website. There are other links for your index page you can fix, such as the cards on <b>lines 106, 120, 134</b>, and the footer on <b>lines 155, 162, 169, and 176</b>. Simply use what you've learned above. That's it!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_34,Awesome! I love what you've done to the site.,ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_35,"You can also fix the links for your other pages such as the About Me, My Favorite Things, and Contact Me pages. Remember, these pages are individual files, so you have to update the links for each page.",daemon,,,
