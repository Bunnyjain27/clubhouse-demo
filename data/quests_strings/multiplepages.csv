MULTIPLEPAGES_NOTINSTALLED,"""Uh-oh! Looks like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt> isn't installed!

You need to download it from the App Center because we'll be using it for this activity.

Click the icon named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">App Center</span></tt> on the Desktop, then search for <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">Sublime Text</span></tt>, and install it. """,,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_1,"Hiya, <b>{{user_name}}</b>! Great job with the second Bootstrap quest. You've mastered how to build your first web page. Most websites have multiple pages such as About, Support, Products, and others to make them more interesting for their audience.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_2,"In this activity, we're going to take the next step in your web development journey by learning how to link to different pages of your site.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_3,Great! Let's get started. We've added the files you're going to use in your Documents folder - let's take a look at them.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_4,"The lower-left corner of the screen with the icons is called the <b>taskbar</b>. Click the yellow folder to launch the file explorer, click the <b>Documents</b> link on the left panel of the window, and open the <b>multiplepages</b> folder.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_5,"The folder should contain the <b>about.html</b>, <b>contact.html</b>, <b>favs.html</b>, <b>index.html</b> files and three folders: <b>css</b>, <b>images</b>, and <b>js</b>. The index, about, contact, and favs files are all different pages for your website. If you ever need a refresher of the file names, come back here.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_6,"Let's take a look at the page we'll be using in this part of the activity- <b>right-click</b> on the <b>index.html</b> file, and select <b>Open With Google Chrome</b>. If you are using a Hack computer, use two fingers and click on the mouse pad to <b>right-click</b>.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_7,The Chrome browser should launch with your web page. The web page should look familiar because it was built using the same components in the previous Bootstrap activity.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_8,"At the top of the page, click on the About Me, My Favorite Things, and Contact Me links in the navigation bar. The page doesn't change because the link doesn't point to the other pages. Let's fix that.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_9,You can do it!,ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_10,We'll be using Sublime Text to edit the code for your webpage. Go back to your multiplepages folder by pressing the <b>alt + tab</b> buttons. ,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_11,"Right-click on the <b>index.html</b> file and select <b>Open With Other Application</b>. In the popup window, if you see Sublime Text highlighted in your Recommended Applications, click the <b>Select</b> button. Otherwise, click the <b>View All Applications</b>, then <b>Sublime Text</b>, and the <b>Select</b> button.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_12,"Here's a quick tip: If you need to resize a window, like Sublime Text, hit the <b>windows button + arrow left</b> to snap it to the left. If you press the <b>windows button + arrow right</b>, the window will snap to the right.",ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_13,Sublime Text will open and display the code for your page. Take a moment to look over the code and find the links you'll need to fix. Don't worry; we'll walk you through it. :) Let's get started.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_14,HTML links are defined with the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag and the link destination is specified with <b>href</b>. Look at line 25 in Sublime Text. The <b>href</b> on the line doesn't have a location right now. The link should appear within the quotation marks.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_15,"Let's tell the link to point to the index.html file in your Documents folder. Type in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">index.html</span></tt> between the quotation marks.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_16,"Notice that there is now a dot at the tab for your index.html file in Sublime Text. The dot tells you that you have some unsaved changes. Any unsaved changes will not be shown, so let's save it. ",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_17,"Press <b>ctrl + s</b> to save the file with your changes. The dot in the tab should now turn into an x. Now, each time you hit the Home link, the index.html file will load. Let's test it out.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_18,"Hit <b>alt + tab</b> to go back to the Chrome browser tab that says ""Hello, world!"", refresh the page, and click on the <b>Home</b> link in the navigation bar at the top of the page. The page doesn't change because we're already at the index.html page. Let's fix the next link in the navigation bar.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_19,Hit <b>alt + tab</b> to go back to Sublime Text and check out the <b>href</b> link on line 32. Do you notice something missing? You guessed it - the link to the file is missing. Let's fix that.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_20,"Type in the following between the quotation marks <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">about.html</span></tt> Notice that there is now a dot at the tab for your index.html file in Sublime Text. Save your changes by hitting <b>ctrl + s</b>. ",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_21,"Hit <b>alt + tab</b> to go back to the Chrome browser tab that says ""Hello, world!"", refresh the page, and click on the <b>About</b> link in the navigation bar at the top of the page. Your website should now display the About Me page.",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_22,Way to go! I'm sending a virtual high-five!,riley,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_23,You've just linked your index.html page to about.html. Let's move onto the next link in your navigation bar. Hit the back button on your Chrome browser to return to the previous page.,daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_24,"Hit <b>ctrl + tab</b> to go back to Sublime Text and check out the <b>href</b> link on line 39. Let's add the following link to point to the favs file: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">favs.html</span></tt> Don't forget to save the Sublime Text file by hitting <b>ctrl + s</b>.",daemon,,,

That's it!",daemon,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_31,Awesome! I love what you've done to the site.,ada,,,
MULTIPLEPAGES_32,"You can also fix the links for your other pages such as the About Me, My Favorite Things, and Contact Me pages. Remember, these pages are individual files, so you have to update the links for each page.",daemon,,,
