MIGRATION_QUEST_NAME,DEBUG - MIGRATION QUEST - DEBUG,,,,
MIGRATION_WELCOME,"Hey, *{{user_name}}*! Welcome back to Hack! There have been quite a few changes around here recently, so I thought I'd run you through them.",,,,
MIGRATION_WELCOME2,"The Clubhouse is no longer on the side of the screen - Now it's an icon on the Desktop, like any other app.",,,,
MIGRATION_OPENIT,Give it a click!,,,,
MIGRATION_OLDSTUFF1,"Do you like the new place? We've just moved in, but it already feels like home.",,,,
MIGRATION_OLDSTUFF2,"If you're wondering how to get to the games you used to play in the old Clubhouse, don't worry.",,,,
MIGRATION_OLDSTUFF3,"We upgraded your permissions to the maximum level - everything's unlocked for you, now!",,,,
MIGRATION_OLDSTUFF4,"You can go anywhere you like in *Sidetrack*, *Lightspeed*, *Fizzics*...",,,,
MIGRATION_OLDSTUFF5,"It's one of our ways of saying ""thanks"" to you for sticking with us in our early days.",,,,
MIGRATION_NEWSTUFF,"Now, about the new Clubhouse...",,,,
MIGRATION_HACKMODE1,"There's a new system we've added, called *Hack Mode*. When you're in Hack Mode (like you are now), you can use flip-to-hack on all the apps and games that support it.",,,,
MIGRATION_HACKMODE2,"Also, your desktop and cursor will change to remind you.",,,,
MIGRATION_HACKMODE3,That *big switch on the right* controls Hack Mode.,,,,
MIGRATION_HACKMODE4,"If you switch Hack Mode OFF, youâ€™ll go back to the regular desktop, and all your hacking tools will shut down.",,,,
MIGRATION_HACKMODE5,"Think of it sort of like 'stealth mode' - you can use it if someone else needs to use the computer, or you need to do your homework.",,,,
MIGRATION_ACTIVITIES1,"In this new version of Hack, you can play whatever activities you want, whenever you want.",,,,
MIGRATION_ACTIVITIES2,"*Up top*, you'll see the Pathways button - Pathways organize activities into categories like Web, OS, Games, Art, and Maker.",,,,
MIGRATION_ACTIVITIES3,You can also talk to all of us - we've got the activities organized by our common interests.,,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE1,Do you see that picture with your name on it in the *upper left*? That's your *Profile*.,,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE2,"Everyone who uses Hack is different, and we want to recognize that. Did you notice how I knew your name earlier, *{{user_name}}*?",,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE3,"Now, if you want to be called something else, you can change that.",,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_ASK,Would you like to learn how to do that right now?,,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_POS,Sure!,,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_NEG,Not now...,,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_CHANGENAME1,"If you look in the *far bottom right* corner of the whole screen, you'll see a little picture.

Click that, and it'll pop up a menu. From that menu, click *Settings*",,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_CHANGENAME2,"Once you've clicked that, you'll be in the *Settings* app.",,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_CHANGENAME3,"Go to the *Details* category (you might need to scroll down), and then the *Users* category.",,,,
MIGRATION_PROFILE_CHANGENAME4,All done? Let's move on.,,,,
MIGRATION_END1,"That's pretty much all the major changes to Hack - it's a lot, I know, but we think it's a big improvement. Explore the Clubhouse and check out all the new things there are to do!",,,,
MIGRATION_END2,And from all of us here - thanks for coming back and sticking with us. We've got a lot of cool stuff planned!,,,,
