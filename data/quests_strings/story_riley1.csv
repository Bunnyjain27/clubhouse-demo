STORY_RILEY1_1,"Hi! I knew we were getting a new student at the Academy, as part of that new program, but I didn't know that was, like, now!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_2,"I'm Riley, and I am sooo excited to have you here! I was part of some advanced program-thing, and there's nobody my age around, so‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_3,"Anyway! You're here! I have to show you SO MANY things, this place is amazing.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_4,"I, uh, don't want to pry, but‚Ä¶ what's up with your avatar? It's like you're not really here, or something.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_5,"There you are, Riley! I was hoping you two would find each other! Riley, *{{user_name}}* is our remote student. They're on a very low-bandwidth link- remember your networking lessons?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6,"Oh, so they can't answer me?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7,"They can, but only with 1 bit - a 'yes' or a 'no' only. Isn't that right, *{{user_name}}*?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7_RPOS,See?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7_RNEG,Your sense of humor certainly matches Riley's. I see some joint pranks in your future‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_8,"It's ok you can't say much  - Saniel says I talk more than enough on my own! Actually, he says:",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_9,"*""Riley, have you been altering the acoustics of my classroom again? Every time I detect several voices, they're all yours. That's quite a trick‚Ä¶ but this is History of Algorithms, not Ventriloquism.""*",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_10,That's quite a good imitation of Dr. Rowe.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_11,"It is, isn't it? I'm glad to hear that at least some part of me seems to be rubbing off on her.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_12,"Saniel! Uh, hi.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_13,"I'm an easy target, Riley, and I know it. Now, if you really wanted to make someone jump, you could work on imitating Dr. Hart.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_14,"Estelle? I can't ever seem to find her. I'll be looking all over and hear from someone that she's in the Observatory, then Faber will tell me he just ran into her near Admin...",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_15,...And then someone else will say she's in the Library‚Ä¶ it's like she moves at light speed around this place!,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_16,And just when you think you'll never find her and stop‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_17,"I know, right? She'll pop up right next to you! I want to learn how to do THAT.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_18,"You'd no doubt spend the first week or so trying to see how far you could make us jump in fright. Then again, you would always be on time to class, I suppose. Perhaps it's worth the trade?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_19,"Aw, come on, that was only one week!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_20,"Don't worry, Riley, Dr. Rowe still won't let me use the book-shelving robot after *the incident*.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_21,Just because there's a 'high' speed setting doesn't mean that it's safe. You nearly took my head off!,saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_22,"I stopped it at *least* 10 feet from you, and one of the cats jumped onto the controls!",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_23,"I suppose a high-speed trip around the archives isn't the worst thing that could happen to a cat. It didn't take too long to clean up, either.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_24,"Hmm. Speaking of cats... Riley, could you come help me feed the feline masses, please?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_25,"Sure thing, Dr. Rowe! I gotta run, *{{user_name}}*, but it was great to meet you! I can't wait to see the fun things we'll do in the future.",riley,,,
