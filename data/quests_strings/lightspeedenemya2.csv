LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUESTION,The new enemy in LightSpeed isn't working quite right. Could you help me?,Ada,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'd love to,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_LAUNCH,Launch LightSpeed as usual.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_EXPLANATION,"Last time you added a new enemy, but it's no different than the asteroid. We can make it much more interesting.

Go to the hack panel and let's look at the code for that enemy.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE,"Select the new enemy on the dropdown and you'll see the code that updates its position.

The function update_obstacle() takes care of moving it. Its y coordinate changes how far up the screen it is.

Make y smaller every frame.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT1,"For example, try subtracting 10 from the y coordinate every time update_obstacle() is called.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT2,obstacle.position.y = obstacle.position.y - 10;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT3,Then run the level again and see how your changes affected things.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_PLAYING,Let's see if that worked...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_NOTMOVING,"No, that's not quite right. The enemies still aren't moving. Let's go back.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_GOINGUP,"Almost. You got them to move, but they're going up instead of down. Make y smaller instead of larger.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_SUCCESS,"That's it! That makes the level more exciting, don't you think?",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ABORT,We can do it later.,,,
