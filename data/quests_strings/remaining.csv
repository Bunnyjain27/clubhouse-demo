STORY_ADA1_1,"Hi again, {{user_name}}! I was so excited when Dr. Rowe mentioned that the remote student program was approved.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_10,"All this technology does create new problems, though. The people that control a program or a service decide how other people can use it.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_11,"If you control a search engine, you can control what information people can find with it. For example - If you don't like dogs, and you own a search engine, you can just make it so that it will never show pictures of dogs, ever. That's a problem.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_12,"This is why you need to learn how these systems work. If you know how something works, you can make it work *for you*, instead of as a way to control you.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_13,"If you don't understand the system, other people will will always control what you can learn, do, or say. That's why learning about all this is so important!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_14,"‚Ä¶ Wow, that was quite a speech. Sorry, these things are *REALLY* important to me -  I get all excited to talk about them and just *go*.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_15,"Hey Ada, how's it going?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_16,"Hi, Faber! I was just seeing how {{user_name}} was adjusting to the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_17,Cool! I actually had some data I wanted to collect - I'm trying to optimize the program the emitters use to project your avatar. Hopefully I can keep you from accidentally walking through solid objects and things like that.,faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_18,"It's pretty cool to see, but man, if you appeared out of a wall in front of me I'd yell loud enough to wake Dr. Rowe out of a nap!",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_19,"Haha! I just had the image of you jumping, and everything in your toolbelt flying all over‚Ä¶",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2,"
I know it's not easy - you're the first person to test this system, and you have to deal with a totally new set of people, in a new place...",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_20,"Oh, man, you should have seen me yesterday. Dr. Hart surprised me in the Maker Space - I didn't know she was there until she said ""I think you missed soldering a connection on this board.""",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_21,"I jumped, my stool tipped over, I fell, and I grabbed the welding bench on the way down... and it flipped over onto me. What a mess. Pretty sure I'll be washing metal chips out of my hair for the next week.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_22,"Oh my‚Ä¶ I can just see you, ""Waah!"" and then the bench goes ""CRASH"" and Dr. Hart is just looking at you‚Äî",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_23,"Yeah, she's looking at me like I'm a wrench in the hammer rack. I was so embarrassed! But, you know, she just smiled and helped me up, saying ""Does that happen a lot? We should get you a better stool.""",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_24,That's very kind of her.,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_25,"Yeah, she's the best, even if she does scare the living daylights out of me sometimes.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_26,"It's moments like this that make me so glad I'm here, at the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_27,"If I had left, I'd probably be making some useless gadget for people who don't need more distractions. What about you?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_28,"Oh, I imagine I'd be at some research center. Maybe working on gravity waves. This is much more rewarding, though.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_29,"So, {{user_name}}, how are you feeling about the Academy so far?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_29_RNEG,"Don't worry - Just learn as much as you can. I didn't know what I wanted to do until this one night, when I realized I had been in the machine shop since 10AM that morning... and it was 4AM, the next morning.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_29_RPOS,Awesome! I love seeing new people get all charged up about this place - it's such a cool opportunity.,faber,hurray,,
STORY_ADA1_3,"So, how are you doing?",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_30,What was that noise?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_31,"Oh! That's my data collector, it's all finished.
Great talking with you guys, but I gotta run and load this into my program if I want it to finish in time.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_32,In time for what?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_33,"Dr. Hart got me a spot on the servers so I can run my simulations... But she had to fake a maintenence request to get the processor time, so I've got a pretty tight deadline.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_34,"Good luck, Faber!
Well, {{user_name}}, I have to be going - but I'll see you later. Have fun!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_3_RNEG,"Don't get discouraged - I know it's hard to be so limited in what you can say and do. If you keep going, I'm sure you'll figure it out.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_3_RPOS,"Wow, you *are* a fast learner. I knew you'd be a good fit here - It's great to see you succeed so easily.",ada,hurray,,
STORY_ADA1_4,All of us at the Academy are here to support you. We want you to be able to learn whatever you want! ,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_5,"One of our goals is to let you hack *any* program in the operating system. Don't worry, we'll teach you how to do it when the time comes.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_6,"Your arrival at The Academy is the beginning of an exciting journey - We want everyone to learn about computers, programming, and the digital world.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_7,"The Earth is changing pretty fast, and as more parts of everyone's lives become digital, people could be left behind.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_8,"You used to have to use a computer to use the internet, and cell phones could only make phone calls.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_9,"Now, every cell phone can use the Internet, plus hundreds of different programs - and it's much faster than your old computer was!",ada,,,

STORY_FABER1_1,"Hey there, {{user_name}} - I don't know if we've been fully introduced. I‚Äôm Faber, I run the Maker Space out near the Observatory.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_10,"Knowing you, Faber, you'd be trying to get me to build some kind of rocket-powered train.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_11,"Hey, they say to use what you know, and you know rockets! I've seen your welds before - superb.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_12,"It *is* always nice to have your work complimented, but these days I investigate the stars mainly through a telescope.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_13,"And your simulations, of course - what's the latest?",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_14,"It's still running - I launched a probe on a long-track slingshot out beyond the heliopause - it should only take a week or so more, I think.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_15,That's past the edge of the solar system! Got any theories about what you'll find?,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_16,"I do - but I'm not saying anything until I see the data. No evidence, no conclusion.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_17,"See, now that sounds just like Saniel.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_18,"That reminds me, do you know where he is? I need to adjust some settings on my simulation cluster and find some more disk space‚Ä¶",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_19,Did you check the bottom of the Archives? I heard him talking about setting up a hammock down there. He said it was because the furnace provided ideal white noise for napping...,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2,"It‚Äôs always great to have another new student around - Say, do you like shortbread?",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_20,...I think he's just trying to find a spot the cats won't steal.,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_21,"I should have guessed  - and to think that when we first met, I thought he'd grow out of that 'napping thing.' I'll look there. See you later, Faber.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_22,"Estelle‚Äôs been here since the the Academy‚Äôs founding. It's easy to feel intimidated around her, even though she's so nice.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_23,Just seeing her reminds me there‚Äôs always some way I can improve or something I can learn more about. It's great motivation!,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_24,"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got somewhere to be, but it was great to meet you. See you around!",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2_RNEG,"That‚Äôs cool - Let me know what your favorite cookie is, we can try a batch in my solar oven some time!",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2_RPOS,Awesome! I‚Äôll double my recipe next time I make some. Can‚Äôt wait for you to try it.,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_3,"Anyway, if you‚Äôre interested in making physical things -  you know, stuff with lights, switches, servos, wheels...",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_4,"Stop by the Maker Space and take a look around. I‚Äôve got a ton of cool projects planned, and I'm sure you can help.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_5,"If you just want to just hang out, that‚Äôs cool too. Bring your favorite music and we can make mixes‚Ä¶ or just jam out.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_6,"...And maybe you can stop by the Observatory, too, while you‚Äôre over there.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_7,"Hi, Estelle! This is our newest student, I was just telling them about the Maker Space.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_8,"I'm sure there were cookies involved, too. You've got a clever way of making sure everyone sees what you've got going on out there.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_9,"Hey, just trying to make the trip worth it for everyone. You know, if all you wanted was to bring more people out, you could help me design a transport system‚Ä¶",faber,,,

STORY_RILEY1_1,"RILEY: Hi! I knew we were getting a new student at the Academy, as part of that new program, but I didn't know that was, like, now!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_10,That's quite an impression of Dr. Rowe.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_11,"It is, isn't it? I'm glad to hear that at least something of my demeanor seems to be rubbing off on her.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_12,"Saniel! Uh, hi.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_13,"I'm an easy target, Riley, and I know it. Now, if you really wanted to make someone jump, you could work on impersonating Dr. Hart.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_14,"Estelle? She's a tough one, I can't ever seem to find her. I'll be looking all over and hear from someone that she was in the Observatory, then Faber will tell me he just ran into her near Admin...",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_15,...And then someone else will say she's in the Library‚Ä¶ it's like she moves at light speed around this place!,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_16,And just when you think you'll never find her and stop‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_17,"I know, right? She'll pop up right next to you! I want to learn how to do THAT.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_18,"You'd no doubt spend the first week or so trying to see how far you could make us jump in fright. Then again, you would always be on time to class, I suppose. Perhaps it's worth the trade?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_19,"Aw, come on, that was only one week!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_2,"I'm Riley, and I am sooo excited to have you here! I was part of some advanced program-thing, and there's nobody my age around, so‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_20,"Don't worry, Riley, Dr. Rowe still won't let me hold any more of our wax cylinder collection.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_21,"That was a priceless artifact from the 19th century, you know.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_22,"We had just finished making a duplicate, and one of the cats jumped onto my shoulders!",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_23,"Well, yes, but it's the principle of the thing. At least the data is still safe. And the cats.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_24,That really IS the most important part.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_25,"In the end, yes. Life is the most precious thing of all. Speaking of which, Riley, could you come help me feed the cats, please?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_26,"Sure thing, Dr. Rowe! I gotta run, {{user_name}}, but it was great to meet you! I can't wait to see the fun things we'll do in the future.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_3,"Anyway! You're here! I have to show you SO MANY things, this place is amazing.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_4,"I, uh, don't want to pry, but‚Ä¶ what's up with your avatar? It's like you're not really here, or something.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_5,"There you are! I'm not surprised that you found each other already - I can tell you two are going to be great together. Riley, {{user_name}} is our remote student. They're on a very limited-fidelity link- remember your networking lessons?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6,"Oh, so they can't answer me?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7,"They can, but only with 1 bit - a 'yes' or a 'no' only. Isn't that right, {{user_name}}?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7_RNEG,Your sense of humor certainly matches Riley's. I see some joint pranks in your future‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7_RPOS,See?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_8,"Saniel does always say I talk enough to cover for the students that don't‚Ä¶ actually, what he says is:",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_9,"*""Riley, have you been altering the acoustics of my classroom again? Every time I detect several voices, they're all yours. That's quite a trick‚Ä¶ but this is History of Algorithms, not Ventriloquism.""*",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_NEGATIVE,üëé,,,,
STORY_RILEY1_POSITIVE,üëç,,,,
STORY_RILEY2_1,Hey again! I realized that I forgot to introduce you to one of the most important residents of the Academy when we first met.,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_10,Puurrrrow?,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_11,"Also being incredibly cute! I mean, seriously, look at those paws. And that face! Actually don't look too long, I think there's some kind of fractal thing going on there, and it starts to move ‚Äî ",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_12,"‚Äî But someone was clearly trying to capture the *idea* of a cat, and I think they nailed it.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_13,"Felix has been around the Academy as long as anyone can remember, but he‚Äôs been out and about much more often since I arrived.
Ada says it must be my natural charm that lured him out.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_14,"Actually, Riley, I think I said ""your mischievous nature,"" but natural charm is probably just as likely.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_15,Hey Ada! I was just introducing Felix. He seems really interested in {{user_name}}'s avatar!,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_16,"Look at that, he's‚Ä¶ sniffing? Can he sniff even if he doesn't have a nose? {{user_name}}, we‚Äôd better take a look at your connection.
Riley, do you have your network analyzer with you?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_17,"Always! Let's see‚Ä¶ open Wireshark‚Ä¶ There we go, that's the secure tunnel‚Ä¶ and yeah, wow. Look at all that network traffic!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_18,"Interesting. He seems to be sifting all the inbound traffic for the avatar system. Of course, it's encrypted, so there's nothing he can do with it...
Why would a virtual intelligence look at *your* connection?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_19,"Maybe he's just‚Ä¶ doing cat stuff. You know, poking around and trying to see everything?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_2,"It's OK, though, since he was hiding anyway. May I present to you the Felicitous Ephemeral Living Intelligence, eXperimental‚Ä¶ Felix!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_20,"It very well could be that. Felix's programming could just be directing him to look at everything he can find. If that were true, though, then we'd see him all over, all the time. He'd be quite a distraction during finals.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_21,"Aw, did you have to remind me about finals?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_22,"That's months away, Riley.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_23,"Yeah, but it's still a drag! You know I'm all about my classes, why do I have to do some big test?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_24,"Testing is an important part of learning - It's about being able to apply your knowledge to a new problem, with restrictions. It's the surest way of seeing whether you really learned the lessons or not.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_25,"Hmm. New problems‚Ä¶ maybe that's why Felix is so interested. You're the newest thing here, {{user_name}}! Your network connection, your way of interacting with The Academy - it's all new to Felix!",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_26,"So is he‚Ä¶ learning? If he's learning, does that mean‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_27,"I don't think he's an AI, Riley. If he's showing responses that you're never seen before, it might be due to new stimuli.
*""When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not Zebras.""*",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_28,"So... that means‚Ä¶ he's a horse? Seriously, what does that mean?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_29,"It means that you should always consider the most commonly found solution to a problem first, before moving to less common possibilities.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_3,Mrrow.,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_30,"For example: All the words in one of your papers turning into ""meow"" just two hours before the deadline... well, I think you see where I'm going with this.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_31,"Hey, come on, what else would a cat type?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_32,"I did give you an extension for that one, Riley. Dr. Rowe might not have been quite as understanding. And while we're on the subject-",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_33,Brrrip! Mrzzrzrzrzrrhhhh‚Ä¶,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_34,"Felix! Don't corrupt my papers, it's not nice.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_35,Nyan.,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_36,"Wait, what's that in his mouth?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_37,Is that‚Ä¶?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_38,"False alarm! Looks like it's a fragment of code that shows up‚Ä¶ as a mouse. Yeech. Gross, but impressive, all at the same time.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_39,Fascinating... That is a VERY complex masking function.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_4,Felix. Buddy. Help me out here. Do a trick? Please?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_40,What language is that 'mouse' even written in?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_41,"Hmm. Analyzing - File header is consistent with source code, running lexical analysis. High probability of an interpreted language, severely minified and macroed, with a custom preprocessor‚Ä¶",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_42,"Uh, a little lost here‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_43,"Oh! I'm sorry, I got carried away. I think it's source code, but very highly optimized, to the point where it's not even human-readable any more.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_44,"Cleverly done, but not enough to hide the system calls to networking routines, and then some kind of traffic analysis. It's offloading that analysis to multiple different servers... Felix, where did you find this?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_45,"Brbrbrbr.
`<Felix gurgles smugly.>`",felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_46,Does he do that just mess with us?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_47,"I'm sure he's just proud that he's gotten us to pay so much attention to him. By the way, can I have a copy of‚Ä¶ let's call it 'mouse.txt'?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_48,"Go for it! I'm going to try and figure out how that file was using a fake image‚Ä¶ Maybe I can use it bait my ""Felix trap"" - or, as I call it, 'infinite-ear-scratches.exe'",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_49,Good luck. Let me know if Felix brings any more surprises in!,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_5,`<Felix licks his paw.>`,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_50,"Definitely. Who would have thought a virtual cat would bring in a virtual mouse? See ya, {{user_name}}!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_6,Anything?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_7,`<Felix stares off into the distance.>`,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_8,"OK, so his name isn't actually an acronym, but he is really impressive from at least one point of view -",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_9,"I've never seen anyone replicate a cat's behavior so completely and accurately. Especially, you know‚Ä¶ the annoying parts.
Like not listening to anything I ask him to do! Ever!",riley,,,

STORY_SANIEL1_1,"Hello, {{user_name}} - I was wondering when you'd stop by. You and Riley are the results of a long-standing project of mine.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_10,"The Archives are always open to any student - with the exception of the Restricted Stacks. Some things are too easily misused. That said, a simple request will usually open them up... with my supervision.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_11,"Yeah, but supervision means you can't look at anything *really exciting*!",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_12,"If you consider suppressed computational theorems to be *really exciting*, Riley, then I have severely misjudged you...",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_13,"...both for your skill in mathematics and for your preferred reading material, not to mention your knack for‚Ä¶ physical intrusion.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_14,Um‚Ä¶ Does that mean I'm in trouble?,riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_15,"I would be quite a poor teacher if I punished you for 'breaking in' so easily. If you can open a door by pressing the handle into the frame, and then lightly kicking the bottom, it's not very secure.",saniel,,,

Wait, then you *also* know that there's nothing in that room but drawers full of square plastic cards with holes in the middle!",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_17,"I must confess I was a step ahead of you, Riley. I moved the Restricted Stacks a month or so ago, but forgot to change the sign.",saniel,,,

...Research backups of numerous Academy projects - VEXIL, SQUARE MUSHROOM, and some others. Yes.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_21,"Wow! It's crazy that you can remember things like that, I have trouble just keeping track of my passwords.
How did you learn to do that?",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_22,"There's an ancient way of thinking called the ""Method of Loci‚Äù. You can call it a 'memory palace,' though. Imagine a building in your mind - every piece of furniture, every room, every drawer of every nightstand.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_23,"Then, imagine that you are putting information you want to remember into objects in the rooms - Put a fact in a drawer, for example.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_24,"You memorize the path you take to get to the object. This helps you remember the object, and therefore the information connected to that object.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_25,What you're doing is hacking your brain - you use your memory of places and directions to point to facts instead.,saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_26,"Woah. That's‚Ä¶ that's way beyond next-level. If anyone else had told me that, I wouldn't believe it.",riley,,,
