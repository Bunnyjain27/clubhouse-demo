INTRO_EPISODESTAB,"The Episodes tab helps you keep track of where you are. It's good to check here when you start to play. 

You'll see the episodes you've finished here along with new ones that await.

So now you've finished Episode 1 and we're starting Episode 2.

INTRO_EXPLANATION,"Before we get started on new challenges, let’s go check out our progress.

Click on the Clubhouse and then on the Episodes tab.",,,,quests/quest2-riley-hi
INTRO_QUESTION,Hi there! Glad you’re here  =^._.^=   Ready to do some more exploring?,riley,,,
INTRO_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,quests/quest2-riley-hi
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK,Nice hack!,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK_HINT1,I wonder if anything happened to the gate? Click the Flip to Hack button again.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL,Beautiful! All new students must solve this puzzle.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT1,Match it by moving the sliders and the doors will unlock.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT2,Keep trying! Move the sliders until the gold wave fits into the groove. ,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME,How do you open a locked gate with no key?,ada  ,,quests/ada-intro,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME_HINT1,What's that button on the left?,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_1,"What a ride! We decoded a hidden message, followed a treasure map, and walked away with pirate's booty!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_2,This wouldn't be complete without a way to show off your prize - and I've done a little digging to figure out how.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_3,"Let's get to where we stored your prize - `cd Pictures`, then `ls` to make sure the file's there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_4,"Great! Let's get this on your screen, now.",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_5,"Look down in the bottom right of the screen, and click your user picture. From that popup menu, click `Settings`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_6,The `Settings` app is where all the internals of the OS are controlled. Look on the left side of the window and click `Background`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_7,"... and from here, click `Background`, and then the `Pictures` tab. Your treasure should show up!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_8,"Just double-click it, and that'll set it as your background.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_9,"Check it out! Now you've got an brand-new desktop background - anyone asks where you got it, you send 'em to me!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_END,"Thanks for letting me teach you some cool stuff, {{user_name}} - I had a lot of fun doing it. Keep an eye out for more!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTBACKGROUND_LAUNCH,Pop the Terminal open and let's get to it.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_1,Hey {{user_name}}! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_10,"After the colon (:) is where you are in the file system. `~` means your `home` directory, where all your stuff is.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_11,"The file system is, well, like a big cabinet full of folders, most of them inside other, bigger folders.",,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_12,"You might also hear these folders called *directories*, sometimes.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_13,"To see what's around you in the current directory, we'll use `ls` (that's lower-case L, lower-case S)",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_14,`ls` is a command that *lists* everything in the directory you're in. It's like looking around in a room.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_15,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_16,"Cool! That should have shown you a list of items, then given you a new prompt.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_17,That means that the terminal is ready for another command.,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_18,"If you saved any files inyour home directory, you'd see them here...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_19,"Do you remember creating a directory named ""yarnbasket""? What's that doing here?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know those scenes in movies where they hack into computer systems?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_20,Let's check it out. To go into another folder (or directory) we need to use the `cd` command.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_21,`cd` stands for *change directory*. You also need to tell it where to go - so let's do `cd yarnbasket`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_22,"Your prompt should change - It should say `yarnbasket`, since you did `cd yarnbasket`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_23,"Now that you're here, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_24,"Is that a file named.... *mouse*? Ew, Felix!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_25,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&^w!_",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_26,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_27,"I love that cat, but he drives me nuts sometimes. He never does anything when you need him to!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_28,"Well, if Felix won't help us, we'll just have to use a different cat.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_29,"The program *cat* helps you open files - it shows their data on the screen, right in the terminal.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_3,"That's *supposed* to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_30,You can actually `cat` any file - but only text files will be anything you can read. ,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_31,Let's check out that file - type `cat mouse` to `cat` the file named *mouse*.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_32,LOL! Looks like Felix played one of his pranks on us... Just like a real cat.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_33,"That was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got much more planned for next time!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_34,Catch you later!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_4,"Just a couple things before we start - when I do text like *this*, it's important.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_5,Text `like this` is a command - something you could type into the terminal.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_6,So if I say *don't* type `destroyallfiles`... hehehe.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_7,Let's get started - I'll open the Terminal open for you.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_8,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_9,"It means that the terminal is using your account, on your computer. But what's after the colon (`:`)?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTCATMOUSE_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited, we're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_10,"To move a file, we need to use the *m*o*v*e command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_11,"Like *grep*, *mv* needs some extra info - It needs the file you want move, then the place you want to move it.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_12,So... `mv treasure.png ∼/Pictures/` That moves it into your Pictures folder. (`∼` means your home directory),riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_2,Do `cat savedresult` (or whatever you named your file last time).,riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_3,"Like I said, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_4,"You can do this 2 ways - either do `cd <the first directory>`, `cd <the second directory>` and so on, or...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_5,"... you can string them together - `cd all/strung/together/like/this`. Your choice, they'll both get us where we want to go.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_6,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_7,Sweet! Treasure! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_8,"Haha! I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_9,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_END,"Great job! For the final lesson, I have something special planned...",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTFOLLOW_LAUNCH,Open up the Terminal and let's roll out!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"There's one last trick, though - see, normally, `grep` looks for a group of letters, but we actually want everything that's NOT those letters. ",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,"So we have to add `-v`, for in*v*ert - that tells `grep` to look for stuff that's NOT the letters we put in.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"Whew! Complicated! Let's put it together - don't hit enter until the very end. `grep`, the command, `-v` to invert...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"`meow`, the word that we want to remove, `treasuremeowp`, the file we're working on...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"...Then `> savedresult` so we can save the result into whatever you want to name the file. I'm going to call it `savedresult`, though.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > savedresult`. Are you sweating? I think my brain needs a sports drink...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"Now the moment of truth - hit *enter*. If you see nothing, that means no errors... then you can `cat savedresult` to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"Interesting. Those forward-slashes mean this is a list of directories. It WAS a treasure map, and it's leading us into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at in `yarnbasket`. So, `cd yarnbasket` to change directory...",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"...And as usual, `ls` to see what we've got in here.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,There we go  - I was interested in `treasuremeowp` - it's got treasure in the name! Let's read it - `cat treasuremeowp`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,"Ok, so that's totally unreadable. Reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it... But! Ada gave me a tip after that happened.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,"She told me that if I ever want to search a file to find words, I can use `grep`. It's a program that goes through files and finds a group of letters.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"But normally, `grep` just does its work and then finishes. If we want to see what it did, we need to tell it to save its work.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_9,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>` - that tells `grep` ""Send your result over here -->"". Then we add a filename, and that saves the result!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_BAK,❮,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_END,We'll tackle that path in the next part - I'm excited to see what we'll find!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_FWD,❯,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_LAUNCH,Launch the Terminal and let's get going!,riley,,,
