POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP,"Click on the PowerUp1 entity. See that handle_powerup() function? That gets called when the ship picks it up.

Let's keep this one simple. We want the ship to be invulnerable for 150 ticks whenever we pick it up.",,,,
POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP_HINT1,There's a variable in the player ship called InvulnerabilityTimer.,,,,
POWERUPS1_CODEPOWERUP_HINT2,You can set it like this ship.invulnerabilityTimer = X . Make X the number of ticks you want. ,,,,
POWERUPS1_END,Fabulous! Come get me whenever you want to dream up a more interesting power up.,,,,
POWERUPS1_EXPLAIN,"Now that you've played around with changing the features of the enemies, let's try something new.

We're going to make some power ups! Power ups are capsules that bring benefits when the player's ship picks them up.

Let's go to the coding panel. ",,,,
POWERUPS1_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
POWERUPS1_LAUNCH,"Fantastic, so let's get Lightspeed fired up.",,,,
POWERUPS1_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go ahead and launch Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPS1_QUESTION,Let's do something different in Lightspeed.,Ada,,,
POWERUPS1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure thing!,,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN,"Perfect. Now let's try it. Go to level 9 and find the spawn_powerup() function.

We want to create one of these power ups every 10 seconds, so that's every 300 ticks.",,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN_HINT1,"To create a powerup, just return POWERUP0;",,,,
POWERUPS1_SPAWN_HINT2,"And to set it for every 300 ticks, check the tick_count and mod it with 300 just like we did before with enemies.",,,,
POWERUPS1_SUCCESS,Great. Now let's play the level and see if it's all working the way we want it to work. ,,,,
POWERUPS2_ABORT,Abort,,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE,"OK, we want to do an awesome powerup: Whenever it gets picked up, we want all enemies on screen to blow up at once!

All the enemies come in an array called enemies. To blow up just the first enemy, we would call BlowUp(enemies[0]); Try it.",,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2,"Right. But we want to blow them all up. We can find out how many enemies we have by doing len(enemies);

That tells us how many enemies we have in that array. So we could write that function over and over.

But that would be really boring! Let's use a loop instead. A loop lets us repeat some code a number of times.

We start the loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) {} The variable i is incremented every time through the loop.

And inside the loop we can access each enemy with enemies[i]. Blow them all up!",,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2_HINT1,Set up a loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) { ... } and then call the BlowUp() function for each enemy.,,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2_HINT2,You can write it like this: for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) { BlowUp(enemies[i]; },,,,
POWERUPS2_END,Take this XXX. It just might come in handy. See you later!,,,,
POWERUPS2_EXPLAIN,You already know how to create a simple powerup. Let's go to the code for PowerUp2.,,,,
POWERUPS2_EXPLAIN_HINT1,Click on the Flip button and then click on the PowerUp2 entity.,,,,
POWERUPS2_LAUNCH,Let's go to Lightspeed.,,,,
POWERUPS2_PLAY,Great. Let's play through the level and check it out.,,,,
POWERUPS2_QUESTION,Ready to make a new power up?,Ada,,,
POWERUPS2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,,
POWERUPS2_SPAWN,Looks good. Now we need to also spawn PowerUp2 in the spawn_powerup() function.,,,,
POWERUPS2_SUCCESS,Yeah! That worked great. Good job! I think I have something for you.,,,,
