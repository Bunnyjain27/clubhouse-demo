BREAKINGIN_ARCHIVIST,"What's going on here? Didn't I tell you â€“ What happened to the trap? Why is it active?

What? Riley was sucked into the AI trap? What have you done? This is one of my old traps, but it was supposed to be disabled.

You should know that I was the Leviathan hacker. But that's a long story. I think AI's are getting stronger again and we're under attack.

Our first priority is to rescue Riley, but I'm going to need your help for that.",Saniel,,

BREAKINGIN_QUESTION,Got the Stealth Device? Ready to investigate the System again?,Riley,,
BREAKINGIN_QUEST_ACCEPT,I got it right here!,,,
BREAKINGIN_UNLOCKED,"Whoa! It worked! We're in. I wonder what wonders there are here.

All there is here is this weird box? Why does it have the Leviathan sign on the side? And why didn't Saniel want us to see it?

Something is super weird here. Let's see what's inside the box. AHHHGGHHHHHHHGGHHH!!!!",,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_ABORT,See you around!,,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_EXPLANATION,Did you figure out how to decrypt it? I'm sure we need to go in the hacking panel first.,,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_HACK,"Here we are! Alright, so what do we need to do to crack this wide open?",,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_LAUNCH,"Okay Ace, go ahead and launch Leviathan",,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_QUESTION,Ready to have a go at decrypting that booklet?,Riley,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_QUEST_ACCEPT,Born ready!,,,
HACKDEX2DECRYPT_SUCCESS,"Sweet! You did it! Now we can read it.

OMG it's about Leviathan! Total. Genius. Hacker. 

I wonder why it was encrypted. We should scan it all for hints. See you at the Clubhouse.",,,
ID,Text,Speaker,Animation,
INVESTIGATION_ABORT,"Sure, we can put off the investigation a bit.",,,

INVESTIGATION_FLIP,"OK, quiet now. Click the Flip button and let's get in there.",,,
INVESTIGATION_LAUNCH,"There's something fishy going on with Saniel. All the evidence points his way:

The Roster got corrupted when he touched it. He dropped that inactive key.  AND he doesn't even want us in the system!

Let's go to the System now and see what we can learn. ",,,
INVESTIGATION_QUESTION,The time has come for us to do some investigating on our own!,Riley,,
INVESTIGATION_QUEST_ACCEPT,I'm with you!,,,

Leave right now! Don't even think of coming back again.",Saniel,,
INVESTIGATION_UNLOCK,Here we are. Let's see what's hiding in that level 2 that nobody wanted us to see!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_ABORT,Let me know whenever you're ready then.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_CHANGEENEMY,See that spawn_obstacle() function? Right now it just returns 'asteroid'. We want to return 'spinner' for this level.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_CHANGEENEMY_HINT1,Change 'asteroid' to 'spinner' in the spawn function.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_CHANGEENEMY_HINT2,Flip back to the app and start playing the level.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_LAUNCH,Start by launching LightSpeed.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_NEWLEVEL,"OK, I just created level 5. But it's just like the other levels, so I'm going to rely on you to liven it up a bit.

Go to the coding panel.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_NEWLEVEL_HINT1,Press the flip to hack button.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_PLAY,Perfect. Now go ahead and play the level to make sure it works like you wanted.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_QUESTION,Want to create a level in LightSpeed that uses a new enemy?,Ada,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA1_SUCCESS,Nice! The level is quite different now. Feel free to make more changes if you want. I'm sure I'll need your help later.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_ABORT,We can do it later.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE,"Select the new enemy on the dropdown and you'll see the code that updates its position.

The function update_obstacle() takes care of moving it. Its y coordinate changes how far up the screen it is.

Make y smaller every frame.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT2,obstacle.position.y = obstacle.position.y - 10;,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_CODE_HINT3,Then run the level again and see how your changes affected things.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA2_EXPLANATION,"Last time you added a new enemy, but it's no different than the asteroid. We can make it much more interesting.

Go to the hack panel and let's look at the code for that enemy.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE,"Select the spinning enemy and look for the update_enemy() function.

That's where we keep making y a bit smaller every time. Let's stop doing that when it gets to 0.

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_CODE_HINT1,Prevent y from going below 0 with an if statement. Then run the game.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_EXPLANATION,"Now that spinning enemy moves in a diagonal and goes off screen. Let's make sure it stays on screen.

Let's go to the coding panel again.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_GOINGDOWN,Hmm... they're still going below the screen. Go back and make sure you don't update the y position if they go below 0.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_LAUNCH,You know the drill: Launch LightSpeed.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA3_NOTMOVING,Something went wrong and now the enemies aren't moving. Go back to the coding panel and let's fix it.,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE,"We know when they hit the bottom of the screen because y is 0 or less. But how do we change direction?

Let's use the velocity of the enemy. We can start with a velocity of -10 and when we hit bottom, we change it to +10.

Then we just add the velocity to the position every time: enemy.position.y = enemy.position.y + enemy.velocity.y;",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_CODE2,"OK, we need to do a very similar check for going off the top. The top of the screen is in the variable height.

So you can set up an if statement for the position going over height and flipping the velocity.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_EXPLANATION,"The enemies now move in the diagonal and accumulate at the bottom of the screen. Let's make it more interesting.

They should now bounce off the bottom of the screen and start moving up. Let's go to the coding panel.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_GOINGOVER,That's good! However... now they go off the top of the screen. Let's fix that while we're at it. Go back to the code.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_GOINGUNDER,TODO: Going under,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_LAUNCH,Let's go to LightSpeed... Engage!,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_NOTMOVING,Now they aren't moving up and down at all. That's probably because we never set the initial speed. Go back to the code.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_PLAYING,Let's see if they bounce now...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_QUESTION,Let's do one last change to that new enemy.,Ada,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYA4_SUCCESS,"Great! Now they bounce up and down and always stay in the screen. 

By the way, you said earlier you were looking for XXXXX. I have one of those here.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE1,Here we are. Start by spawning 'squid' in the spawn_enemy() function. Then play the level to test it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE2,"Excellent. Now go to the update_enemy() function. If we leave it blank, it'll do nothing, like an asteroid.

Let's have it move up and down like the other enemy, but smoothly, using the sine function.

sin() is a function that creates a smooth wave over time. So set y = sin(this.time); and try it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_CODE3,"How can we make it move more but still use the sin() function? Multiplying it of course!

Multiply sin(this.time) by some number to make it larger. Go ahead and try it.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_LAUNCH,Start by launching LightSpeed.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NEWENEMY,"Perfect. That's the new enemy type, although it's not doing anything interesting yet. Let's fix that.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NEWENEMY_HINT1,Go to the coding panel. Press flip to hack.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_NOENEMY,Hmm... not quite. We don't have any of that enemy in the level. Go back and try to fix it.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAY2,"Hmm... that enemy isn't moving much, is it? That's because sin() returns a number between -1 and 1!

So right now it's just moving a pixel up and down. Go back to the code and let's change it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAY3,"Much better! That number you chose is the amplitude of the sine wave.

Now let's have it move with that amplitude, but slower. Go back to the code.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_PLAYTEST,Let's see if that worked...,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUESTION,Perhaps you're ready to code a whole new enemy on your own?,Saniel,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Yes,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB1_SUCCESS,Excellent! Great job coding your first enemy from scratch!,,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sure,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYB2_SUCCESS,That solution is correct. Well done. Perhaps you could use a XXXXX?,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_EXPLAIN,"OK, first let's set some graphics and some reasonable parameters for the enemy I just created: ENEMY3.",,,

LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_QUEST_ACCEPT,Sounds awesome.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_SPAWN,Cool! I like the graphic you chose for it! Now let's make it appear in a new level. Choose level 8 and spawn Enemy3.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_SPAWN_HINT1,Flip to hack to get to the spawn_enemies() function.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_SPAWN_HINT2,And return ENEMY3 from spawn_enemies().,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC1_SUCCESS,Haha... Nice! Next we should make it more intelligent. Come get me whenever you want to try that.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE,"In the enemy_update() function, we can change the enemy's vertical position by controlling the y coordinate.

But instead of moving in a fixed pattern, we should make it move up if the player is higher, and down if the player is lower.

The player's ship vertical position is stored in playerShipPositionY. Compare it to the enemy y and increase it or decrease it.",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT1,First you should check if the player ship is higher or lower. if (playerShipPositionY > enemy.pos.y) means the player is higher.,,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT2,"In that case, you can increase the enemy position: enemy.pos.y += 1;",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT3,"If it's lower, we can use the else keyword (if (...) { } else { }",,,
LIGHTSPEEDENEMYC2_CODE_HINT4,"And in that case, we can lower the enemy: enemy.pos.y -= 1;",,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_ABORT,Abort,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE,"There. See the spawn_obstacle() function? Someone left it empty. No wonder there are no asteroids.

Try adding return ""asteroid""; and running level 4. What do you think will happen?",,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_CODE2,"What we want is more like an asteroid every second.

Notice that we have the variable tick, which goes up once every frame. Let's spawn it every 30 ticks.

We know 30 ticks have passed when tick mod 30 is 0 (when tick is a multiple of 30). In code it's tick%30.

And we can use an if statement to tie it all together: if (condition) return ""asteroid""; return null;",,,

LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_SUCCESS,Smart work there! Clearly you're ready for something more challenging. Ada will give you the details. ,,,
LIGHTSPEEDFIX2_TOOMANY,"Leaping Antelopes! That's a LOT of asteroids. So many in fact that you blew up the limit.

It turns out the spawn_obstacle() function gets called every frame (about 30 times per second!).

MAKEDEVICE_END,"OK, bye. Let me know if I can help you with any other projects!",,,
MAKEDEVICE_EXPLAIN,"Fantastic. Fantastic. Let's see them.

Okay, we need to solder this one to the board. That one underneath connected to the emitter.

That one amplifying the input, and finally, this one stabilizing the voltages. Aaahhh! Beautiful. All set.",,,

POWERUPS2_ABORT,Abort,,,
POWERUPS2_CODE,"OK, we want to do an awesome powerup: Whenever it gets picked up, we want all enemies on screen to blow up at once!

All the enemies come in an array called enemies. To blow up just the first enemy, we would call BlowUp(enemies[0]); Try it.",,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2,"Right. But we want to blow them all up. We can find out how many enemies we have by doing len(enemies);

That tells us how many enemies we have in that array. So we could write that function over and over.

But that would be really boring! Let's use a loop instead. A loop lets us repeat some code a number of times.

We start the loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) {} The variable i is incremented every time through the loop.

And inside the loop we can access each enemy with enemies[i]. Blow them all up!",,,
POWERUPS2_CODE2_HINT1,Set up a loop like this for (var i=0; i<len(enemies); i++) { ... } and then call the BlowUp() function for each enemy.,,,
