STORY_ADA1_1,"Hi again, {{user_name}}! I was so excited when Dr. Rowe mentioned that the remote student program was approved.
I know it's not easy - you're the first person to test this system, and you have to deal with a totally new set of people, in a new place...",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_10,"Hey Ada, how's it going?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_11,"Hi, Faber! I was just seeing how {{user_name}} was adjusting to the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_12,"Cool! I actually had some data I wanted to collect - I'm trying to optimize the program the emitters use to project your avatar. Hopefully I can keep you from accidentally walking through solid objects and things like that. It's pretty cool to see, but man, if you appeared out of a wall in front of me I'd yell loud enough to wake Dr. Rowe out of a nap!",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_13,"Haha! I just had the image of you jumping, and everything in your toolbelt flying all over‚Ä¶",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_14,"Oh, man, you two should have seen me yesterday when Dr. Hart surprised me in the Maker Space.The first time I knew she was there was when she said ""I think you missed soldering a connection on this board."" I jumped, my stool tipped over, I fell, and I grabbed the welding bench on the way down...  and it flipped over onto me. What a mess.
Pretty sure I'll be washing metal chips out of my hair for the next week.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_15,"Oh my‚Ä¶ I can just see you, ""Waah!"" and then the bench goes ""CRASH"" and Dr. Hart is just looking at you‚Äî",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_16,"Yeah, she looking at me like I'm a wrench in the hammer rack‚Ä¶ Oh boy. I couldn't even talk, I was so embarrassed. But you know, she just smiled and held out her hand to me, saying ""Does that happen a lot? We should get you a better stool.""",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_17,That's very kind of her.,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_18,"Yeah, she's the best, even if she does scare the living daylights out of me sometimes.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_19,"It's moments like this that make me so glad I'm here, at the Academy.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2,"So, how are you doing?",,,,
STORY_ADA1_20,"If I had left, I'd probably be making some useless gadget for people who don't need more distractions. What about you?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_21,"Oh, I imagine I'd be at some research center. Maybe working on gravity waves. This is much more rewarding, though.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_22,"So, {{user_name}}, how are you feeling about the Academy so far?",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_22_RNEG,"Don't worry if you don't know what to do - Just learn as much as you can.
I didn't know what I really wanted to do until this one night - It was 4AM and I realized I had gotten into the machine shop at 10 that morning. I was like ""Huh. I guess I really like this!"" ... and the rest is history.
*<BONG>*",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_22_RPOS,Awesome! I love seeing new people get all charged up about this place - it's such a cool opportunity.,faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_23,What was that noise?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_24,"Oh! That's my data collector, it's all finished.
Great talking with you guys, but I gotta run and load this into my program if I want it to finish in time.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_25,In time for what?,ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_26,"Dr. Hart got me a spot on the servers so I can run my simulations... But she had to fake a maintenence request to get the processor time, so I've got a pretty tight deadline.",faber,,,
STORY_ADA1_27,"Good luck, Faber!
Well, {user_name}}, I have to be going - but I'll see you later. Have fun!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2_RNEG,"Don't get discouraged - I know it's hard to be so limited in what you can say and do. If you keep going, I'm sure you'll figure it out.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_2_RPOS,"Wow, you *are* a fast learner. I knew you'd be a good fit here - It's great to see you succeed so easily.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_3,"All of us at the Academy are here to support you. We want you to be able to learn whatever you want! One of our goals is for you to be able to hack any program - Not just ones we choose, *every* program in the operating system. Don't worry, we'll teach you how to do it when the time comes.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_4,"This is the beginning of an exciting journey for everyone. We need everyone to learn about computers, programming, and the digital world. The Earth is changing pretty fast, and as more parts of everyone's lives become digital, people could be left behind.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_5,"You used to have to use a computer to use the internet, and cell phones could only make phone calls. Now, every cell phone can use the Internet, plus hundreds of different programs - and it's much faster than an old computer was!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_6,"There is problem with all this technology, though. The people that control a program or a service decide how other people can use it. If you control a search engine, you can control what information people can find with it.
For example - If you don't like dogs, and you own a search engine, you can just make it so that it will never show pictures of dogs, ever.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_7,"This kind of thing is a problem! This is why it's so important to understand how systems work - you can make the system work *for you*.
If a system is working *for you*, you can use it to get what *you* need, and not what someone else thinks you need.",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_8,"If you don't understand the technology and systems you use, someone else will always control what you can learn, do, or say.
That's why learning about all this is so important!",ada,,,
STORY_ADA1_9,"‚Ä¶ Wow, that was quite a speech. Sorry, these things are so important to me that I get really excited and just *go*.",ada,,,

STORY_FABER1_1,"Hey there, {{user_name}} - I don't know if we've been fully introduced. I‚Äôm Faber, I run the Maker Space out near the Observatory.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_10,"Knowing you, Faber, you'd be trying to get me to build some kind of rocket-powered train.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_11,"Hey, they say to use what you know, and you know rockets! I've seen your welds before - superb.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_12,"It *is* always nice to have your work complimented, but these days I investigate the stars mainly through a telescope.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_13,"And your simulations, of course - what's the latest?",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_14,"It's still running - I launched a probe on a long-track slingshot out beyond the heliopause - it should only take a week or so more, I think.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_15,That's past the edge of the solar system! Got any theories about what you'll find?,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_16,"I do - but I'm not saying anything until I see the data. No evidence, no conclusion.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_17,"See, now that sounds just like Saniel.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_18,"That reminds me, do you know where he is? I need to adjust some settings on my simulation cluster and find some more disk space‚Ä¶",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_19,"Did you check the bottom of the Archives? I heard him talking about setting up a hammock down there.

He said it was because the furnace provided ideal white noise for napping, but I think he's just trying to find a spot the cats won't steal.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2,"It‚Äôs always great to have another new student around - Say, do you like shortbread?",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_20,"I should have guessed  - and to think that when we first met, I thought he'd grow out of that 'napping thing.' I'll look there. See you later, Faber.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_21,"Estelle‚Äôs been here since the the Academy‚Äôs founding‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs so nice, but it's also very easy to feel intimidated around her.

I feel like she's always reminding me there‚Äôs something I could be doing, or something more I could learn. It's good motivation!

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got somewhere to be, but it was great to meet you. See you around!",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2_RNEG,"That‚Äôs cool - Let me know what your favorite cookie is, we can try a batch in my solar oven some time!",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_2_RPOS,Awesome! I‚Äôll double my recipe next time I make some. Can‚Äôt wait for you to try it.,faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_3,"Anyway, if you‚Äôre interested in making physical things -  you know, stuff with lights, switches, servos, wheels...",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_4,"Stop by the Maker Space and take a look around. I‚Äôve got a ton of cool projects planned, and I'm sure you can help.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_5,"If you just want to just hang out, that‚Äôs cool too. Bring your favorite music and we can make mixes‚Ä¶ or just jam out.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_6,"...And maybe you can stop by the Observatory, too, while you‚Äôre over there.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_7,"Hi, Estelle! This is our newest student, I was just telling them about the Maker Space.",faber,,,
STORY_FABER1_8,"I'm sure there were cookies involved, too. You've got a clever way of making sure everyone sees what you've got going on out there.",estelle,,,
STORY_FABER1_9,"Hey, just trying to make the trip worth it for everyone. You know, if all you wanted was to bring more people out, you could help me design a transport system‚Ä¶",faber,,,
STORY_RILEY1_1,"RILEY: Hi! I knew we were getting a new student at the Academy, as part of that new program, but I didn't know that was, like, now!

I'm Riley, and I am sooo excited to have you here! I was part of some advanced program-thing, and there's nobody my age around, so‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_10,"Saniel! Uh, hi.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_11,"I'm an easy target, Riley, and I know it. Now, if you really wanted to make someone jump, you could work on mimicing Dr. Hart.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_12,"Estelle? She's a tough one, I can't ever seem to find her.

I'll be looking all over and hear from someone that she was in the Observatory, then Faber will tell me he just ran into her near Admin...

...And then someone else will say she's in the Library‚Ä¶ it's like she moves at light speed around this place!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_13,And just when you think you'll never find her and stop‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_14,"I know, right? She'll pop up right next to you! I want to learn how to do THAT.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_15,"You'd no doubt spend the first week or so trying to see how far you could make us jump in fright.

Then again, you would always be on time to class, I suppose. Perhaps it's worth the trade?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_16,"Aw, come on, that was only one week!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_17,"Don't worry, Riley, Dr. Rowe still won't let me hold any more of our wax cylinder collection.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_18,"That was a priceless artifact from the 19th century, you know.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_19,"We had just finished making a duplicate, and one of the cats jumped onto my shoulders!",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_2,"Anyway! You're here! I have to show you SO MANY things, this place is amazing.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_20,"Well, yes, but it's the principle of the thing. At least the data is still safe. And the cats.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_21,That really IS the most important part.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_22,"In the end, yes. Life is the most precious thing of all. Speaking of which, Riley, could you come help me feed the cats, please?",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY1_23,"RILEY: Sure thing, Dr. Rowe! I gotta run, {{user_name}}, but it was great to meet you! I can't wait to see the fun things we'll do in the future.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_3,"I, uh, don't want to pry, but‚Ä¶ what's up with your avatar? It's like you're not really here, or something.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_4,"There you are! I'm not surprised that you found each other already - I can tell you two are going to be great together.

Riley, this is our remote student, {{user_name}}. They're on a very limited-fidelity link- remember your networking lessons?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_5,"Oh, so they can't answer me?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6,"They can, but only with 1 bit - so, yes or no only. Right?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RNEG1,*snort*,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RNEG2,Your sense of humor certainly matches hers. I see some joint pranks in your future‚Ä¶,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_6_RPOS,See?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_7,"Saniel does always say I talk enough to cover for the students that don't‚Ä¶ actually, what he says is:

""Riley, have you been altering the acoustics of my classroom again? Every time I detect several voices, they're all yours.*

*That's quite a trick‚Ä¶ but this is History of Algorithms, not Ventriloquism.""*",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY1_8,That's quite an impression of Dr. Rowe.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY1_9,"It is, isn't it? I'm glad to hear that at least something of my demeanor seems to be rubbing off on her.",saniel,,,
STORY_RILEY2_1,"Hey again! I realized that I forgot to introduce you to one of the most important residents of the Academy when we first met.

It's OK, though, since he was hiding anyway. May I present to you the Felicitous Ephemeral Living Intelligence, eXperimental‚Ä¶ Felix!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_10,"Felix has been around the Academy as long as anyone can remember, but he‚Äôs been out and about much more often since I arrived.

Ada says it must be my natural charm that lured him out.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_11,"Actually, Riley, I think I said ""your mischievous nature,"" but natural charm is probably just as likely.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_12,Hey Ada! I was just introducing Felix. He seems really interested in {{user_name}}'s avatar!,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_13,"Look at that, he's‚Ä¶ sniffing? Can he sniff even if he doesn't have a nose? {{user_name}}, we‚Äôd better take a look at your connection.

Riley, do you have your network analyzer with you?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_14,"Always! Let's see‚Ä¶ open Wireshark‚Ä¶ There we go, that's the secure tunnel‚Ä¶ and yeah, wow. Look at all that network traffic!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_15,"Interesting. He seems to be sifting all the inbound traffic for the avatar system. Of course, it's encrypted, so there's nothing he can do with it...

Why would a low-grade virtual intelligence care about your network traffic?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_16,"Maybe he's just‚Ä¶ doing cat stuff. You know, poking around and trying to see everything?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_17,"It very well could be that. Felix's programming could just be directing him to look at everything he can find.

If that were true, though, then we'd see him all over, all the time. He'd be quite a distraction during finals.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_18,"Aw, did you have to remind me about finals?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_19,"That's months away, Riley.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_2,Mrrow.,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_20,"Yeah, but it's still a drag! You know I'm all about my classes, why do I have to do some big test?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_21,"Testing is an important part of learning - It's about being able to apply your knowledge to a new problem, with restrictions.

It's the surest way of seeing whether you really learned the lessons or not.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_22,"Hmm. New problems‚Ä¶ maybe that's why Felix is so interested. You're new, {{user_name}}!

Your network connection, your way of interacting with The Academy, it's all new to Felix, and that's why he's so interested.",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_23,"So is he‚Ä¶ learning? If he's learning, does that mean‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_24,"I don't think he's an AI, Riley. If he's showing responses that you're never seen before, it might be due to new stimuli.

*""When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not Zebras.""*",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_25,"So... that means‚Ä¶ he's a horse? Seriously, what does that mean?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_26,"It means that you should always consider the most commonly found solution to a problem first.

For example, the problem of all the words in one of your papers turning into ""meow"" just two hours before the deadline...",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_27,What else would a cat type?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_28,"I did give you an extension for that one, Riley. Dr. Rowe might not have been quite as understanding. And while we're on the subject-",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_29,Brrrip! Mrzzrzrzrzrrhhhh‚Ä¶,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_3,Felix. Buddy. Help me out here. Do a trick? Please?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_30,"Felix! Don't corrupt my papers, it's not nice.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_31,Nyan.,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_32,"Wait, what's that in his mouth?",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_33,Is that‚Ä¶?,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_34,"False alarm! Looks like it's a fragment of code that shows up‚Ä¶ as a mouse. Yeech. Gross, but impressive, all at the same time.",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_35,Fascinating... That is a VERY complex masking function.,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_36,\What language is that 'mouse' even written in?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_37,"Hmm. Analyzing - File header is consistent with source code, running lexical analysis‚Ä¶

High probability of an interpreted language, severely minified and macroed, with a custom preprocessor‚Ä¶",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_38,"Uh, a little lost here‚Ä¶",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_39,"Oh! I'm sorry, I got carried away. I think it's source code, but very highly optimized, to the point where it's not even human-readable any more.

Cleverly done, but not enough to hide the system calls to networking routines, and then some kind of traffic analysis.

It's offloading that analysis to multiple different servers... Felix, where did you find this?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_4,`<Felix licks his paw.>`,faber,,,
STORY_RILEY2_40,Brbrbrbr. `<Felix gurgles smugly.>`,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_41,Does he do that just mess with us?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_42,"I'm sure he's just proud that he's gotten us to pay so much attention to him. By the way, can I have a copy of‚Ä¶ let's call it 'mouse.txt'?",ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_43,"Go for it! I'm going to try and figure out how that file was using a fake image‚Ä¶

Maybe I can use it bait my ""Felix trap"" - or, as I call it, 'infinite_ear_scratches.exe'",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_44,Good luck. Let me know if Felix brings any more surprises in!,ada,,,
STORY_RILEY2_45,"Definitely. Who would have thought a virtual cat would bring in a virtual mouse? See ya, {{user_name}}!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_5,Anything?,riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_6,`<Felix stares off into the distance.>`,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_7,"OK, so his name isn't actually an acronym, but he is really impressive from at least one point of view -

I've never seen anyone replicate a cat's behavior so completely and accurately. Especially, you know‚Ä¶ the annoying parts.

Like not listening to anything I ask him to do! Ever!",riley,,,
STORY_RILEY2_8,Puurrrrow?,felixnet,,,
STORY_RILEY2_9,"Also being incredibly cute! I mean, seriously, look at those paws. And that face!

But don't look too long, I think there's some kind of fractal generation going on there, and it starts to move ‚Äî 

‚Äî But someone was really clearly trying to get the *idea* of a cat, and I think they nailed it.",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_1,"SANIEL: Hello, {{user_name}} - I was wondering when you'd stop by. You and Riley are the results of a long-standing project of mine.

I've been trying to get the Academy to search for students wth different ways of learning and problem solving - and finally, here you are.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_10,Um‚Ä¶ Does that mean I'm in trouble?,riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_11,"I would be quite a poor teacher if I punished you for 'breaking in' so easily.

If you can open a door by pressing the handle into the frame, and then lightly kicking the bottom, it's not very secure.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_12,"‚Ä¶ Do you have cameras everywhere? How did you know that?

Wait, then you *also* know that there's nothing in that room but drawers full of square plastic cards with holes in the middle!",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_13,"I must confess I was a step ahead of you, Riley. I moved the Restricted Stacks a month or so ago, but forgot to change the sign.

Those 'plastic cards' are called floppy disks, by the way. There are several types, and they're used for data storage. Old, but useful.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_14,"Oh, cool. I wish I knew what was on them...",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_15,"Hmm. That room, 27B-6? That would be‚Ä¶

...Research backups of numerous Academy projects - VEXIL, SQUARE MUSHROOM, and some others. Yes.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_16,"Wow! It's crazy that you can remember things like that, I have trouble just keeping track of my passwords.

How did you learn to do that?",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_17,"There's an ancient Roman and Greek way of thinking called the ""Method of Loci‚Äù. You can call it a 'memory palace,' though.

You imagine a building in your mind - imagine every piece of furniture, every room, every drawer of every nightstand.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_18,"Then, imagine that you are putting information you want to remember into objects in the rooms - Put a fact in a drawer, for example.

You memorize the path you take to get to the object, which helps you remember the object, and therefore the information.

It's essentially hacking your brain  - you use your memory of places and directions to point to facts instead.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_19,"Woah. That's‚Ä¶ that's way beyond next-level. If anyone else had told me that, I wouldn't believe it.",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_2,"I want the Academy to be more than just a space for teaching and learning, I want it to be a community, based on sharing knowledge.

In my past, I have found my deepest friendships and strongest allies to be the result of communities...",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_20,"Trust, but verify, Riley - so I'll be expecting a short  paper on the method of loci next week.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_21,"Well, I asked for it. Sounds fun, though!",riley,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_22,"""Research is the backbone of inquiry,"" as one of my professors once said. Now, I have to get back to working on my archives.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_23,"Oh, and Riley - They're called the *Restricted Stacks* for a reason. I would prefer to keep this incident... quiet.

Please don't give me a reason to make a fuss. I would normally tell you both to stay out of trouble, but...

Instead, I'll just say 'see you soon"" and leave it at that.",saniel,,,

If you see any cats around the Academy, this is where they live - I seem to accumulate cats the way others accumulate art, or souveniers.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_7,"Now, as I was saying - Communities. Communities preserve knowledge and expertise, and our Academy Archives are no exception.

They are always open to any student - with the exception of the Restricted Stacks. Some things are too easily misused.

That said, a simple request will usually open them up... with my supervision.",saniel,,,
STORY_SANIEL1_8,"Yeah, but supervision means you can't look at anything *really exciting*!",riley,,,
