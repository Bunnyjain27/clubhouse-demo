INTRO_WELCOME,Hi {{user_name}}! Welcome to the Clubhouse!,ada,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK,Nice hack!,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_FLIPBACK_HINT1,I wonder if anything happened to the gate? Click the Flip to Hack button again.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL,Beautiful! All new students must solve this puzzle.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT1,Match it by moving the sliders and the doors will unlock.,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_GOAL_HINT2,Keep trying! Move the sliders until the gold wave fits into the groove. ,,,,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME,How do you open a locked gate with no key?,ada  ,,quests/ada-intro,
OLD_FIRSTCONTACT_WELCOME_HINT1,What's that button on the left?,,,,
OS_ONESHOT_BKRND_1,"What a ride! We decoded a hidden message, followed a treasure map, and walked away with pirate's booty!

This wouldn't be complete without a way to show off your prize - and I've done a little digging to figure out how.",,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_1,Hey {{user_name}}! Ada's always saying we should search out new things to do - so I want to try teaching you some tricks in the *Terminal*!,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_10,`ls` is a command that *l*ist*s* all the files and folders in the directory you're in.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_11,"Huh, this is your /home/ directory, you can tell by the *~* in the prompt... but do you remember creating a directory named ""yarnbasket""?",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_12,Let's check it out. Type `cd yarnbasket` to *c*hange *d*irectory into it. It's just like double-clicking a folder in the File Manager.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_13,"Now that you're here, type `ls` again to see what's inside.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_14,Ew. Is that a file named.... `mouse`? Felix!,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_15,"_Nyan, brrrp? Miao&~^w!_",felixnet,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_16,"`<Felix licks his nose, and vanishes into an air duct.>`",felixnet,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_17,"Well, if that cat won't help us, let's use our own - Type `cat mouse`.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_18,"LOL! Well, yeah, I should have expected something like that.

`cat` reads the contents of a file into your terminal window, so that's what was in the file. You win this round, Felix.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_2,"The Terminal is mondo cool, it's where the REAL magic in the OS happens. You know all those scenes in movies where they're hacking into computer systems?",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_3,"Yeah, those lines of green text are supposed to look like the Terminal. I'm going to teach you the *real* stuff, though!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_4,Let's get started - open the Terminal.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_5,"Nice. See that text on the left there? That's called the *prompt* - it's `your user name`, @, `your computer name`.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_6,"This means that this terminal is logged into your account, on your computer. I know this sounds obvious...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_7,...But Dr. Rowe tells me that you can actually use the Terminal to log into other computers - it's how he works on the Archive servers.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_8,"Uh, I kinda got off-track there, sorry. Anyway! Let's try something out:",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_9,Type `ls` into the Terminal then hit *Enter*.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_BAK,‚ùÆ,,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_END,"Whew, that was fun! You learned *ls*, *cd*, and *cat* - and I've got more planned for next time!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_CAT_FWD,‚ùØ,,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_1,"I'm so excited, we're on the trail of something cool, I know it. Let's take another look at that map.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_2,"Like I said, this looks like a list of directories. Let's follow the trail...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_3,"You can do this 2 ways - either do `cd <the first directory>`, `cd <the second directory>` and so on, or...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_4,"... you can string them together - `cd all/strung/together/like/this`. Your choice, they'll both get us where we want to go.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_5,"Now that you're at the end, let's `ls`...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_6,Sweet! Treasure.png! We found it!,riley,hurray,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_7,"Haha! I feel like a pirate digging up buried treasure. Yarr, matey! Avast!",riley,hurray,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_8,"Like any pirate, we need to get our loot back onto the ship - or, in your case, your home directory.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_9,"To move a file, we need to use the *m*o*v*e command... `mv`. ",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_FOLLOW_END,"Great job! For the final lesson, I have something special planned...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_10,"So, let's put it all together. `grep meow` (that's the word we want to exclude) `treasuremeowp > save_the_result.txt` (that's the file we want `grep` to work on, and then the output file).

So - `grep meow treasuremeowp > hiddentext`. Then, you can use `cat save_the_result.txt` to see the results.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_11,"On my end, that looks like a file with lots of forward-slashes... which means directories. It WAS a treasure map, and it's leading us through a path of directories!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_3,"Last time, we `cat`ed a ""mouse"" into the terminal. That's cool, but there was another file I wanted to look at in `yarnbasket`. So, `cd yarnbasket` to get us to that directory...",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_4,"...And as usual, `ls` to see what we've got in here.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_5,There we go  - I was interested in `treasuremeowp` - it's got treasure in the name! Let's read it - `cat treasuremeowp`.,riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_6,"Ok, so that's totally unreadable. Reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it... But! Ada gave me a tip after that happened.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_7,"She told me that if I ever want to search a file to find words, I can use `grep`. It goes through files and finds a group of letters - Like maybe... ""password:"", if you're doing something dangerous... ~_^",riley,hurray,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_8,"But normally, `grep` just does its work and then finishes. If we want to see what it did, we need to tell it to save its work.",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_9,"In order to get `grep` to save its output to a file, we use `>` - that tells a program ""Send the result of your work over there --> "". After that, we put a file name, and poof! `grep` saves its result!",riley,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_BAK,‚ùÆ,,,,
OS_ONESHOT_MAP_END,We'll tackle that path in the next part - I'm excited to see what we'll find!,riley,,,
