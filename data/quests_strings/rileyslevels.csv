RILEYSLEVELS_QUESTION,Hey there! I'm heading up the search for the fob hidden in Fizzics. Want to join me?,Ada,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_QUESTION_ACCEPT,Of course!,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LAUNCH,"Fantastic. We really need your help! We're all giving everything we have to getting Riley out of there. 

So, Saniel told me that right before Riley was trapped, she was working on a Fizzics assignment. 

She turned in some new Fizzics levels to Saniel and he's implemented them so we can play them. 

So let's play them now and see if we find one of the access fobs. Launch Fizzics and let's go!",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_GETTOLEVEL11,"First, you need to get to level 11.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11,Here we are at level 11! We need to pass this one to get to Riley's secret levels. ,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11_HINT1,Remember: To beat a level you need to fling all the orange balls into the target.,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL11_HINT2,There are no goals in this level. Maybe you should add a goal. ,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_LEVEL12,Great. You made it into Riley's secret levels! Now see if you can beat them all.,,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_NOMOVING,"Good try, but that won't work. Riley programmed it so you can only beat them with the fling tool.",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_SUCCESS,"You did it! That was really clever work! 

Oh hey, I think I found one of those fobs we're looking for! Let's hope this works! ",,,,
RILEYSLEVELS_ABORT,"OK, let's keep exploring this later. ",,,,
