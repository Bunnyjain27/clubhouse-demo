OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_NAME,The Command-line - Grep... is that a fruit?,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn about complex command-line tools, and decode a hidden map. (Part 2 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_LAUNCH,"Find the Terminal icon on the desktop, and let's get going!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we used `cat` to read a file - and there's another one I want to look at now.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"So, check your prompt - are you still in `yarnbasket`? If not, let's `cd yarnbasket` to get in there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,"Now, let's `ls` to see what we've got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,See that file named `treasuremeowp`? That was what I was looking for - it's got treasure in the name!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,Let's see if we can read it - think back to last lesson.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"Ok, so - `cat treasuremeowp`, let's see what it says.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_9,"... Thaaat's totally unreadable. Darn. Ha, it reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"Wait, though - Ada gave me a tip after that happened. She told me there was a way to search *inside* a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,It's a little program called `grep` - Ada told me to think of it like a little monster that sifts through files.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"`grep` is like `cat`- it needs a file to work on. Unlike `cat`, it also needs something to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"Let's try a quick example. We'll use `grep` to look for ""life"" in the file ""rhyme"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"To do that, we type `grep`, then the thing we want it to look for (""life""), then the file we want to look in (""rhyme""), which all comes out as `grep blind rhyme`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"There we go, `grep` returns all the lines in that file that contain the word ""life"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"Let's try that again - find ""blind"" in the file ""rhyme"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"Like before, we type `grep`, the word to look for, `blind`, and then the file, `rhyme`.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_18,"So, that's `grep blind rhyme`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_19,"Nice. More lines came back, because more lines have that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_20,Let's look at the entire file to see what we were searching: `cat rhyme`,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_21,Heh. That's an... interesting rhyme. o_0,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_22,"Anyway... what if we had a file that was longer than this one? We might want to save the results to a file, so we could look at it later.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_23,"To get `grep` to save its output, we use `>`. That tells `grep` ""Send your result over there ->"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_24,"On the other side of the `>`, we put the name of the file we want to use. So let's combine that with the last thing we did.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_25,That should come out as `grep blind rhyme > myfile`,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_26,Now you can type `cat myfile` and see the result!,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_27,We're almost there - is your brain all tangled up yet? I hope *knot*! :D,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_28,"The last piece of our puzzle is a tough one - we've used `grep`, but so far we've had to tell it what to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_29,"Remember that file from the beginning, *treasuremeowp*? (You can `cat` it again if you like) It has a ton of ""meow"" in it, but we want everything that *isn't* that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_30,"Luckily, `grep` has an option we can use to help! `-v`, for *invert*. Instead of showing lines with the word we ask for, it shows us all the lines *without* that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_31,"`-v` goes right after `grep`, but before the search text or file name - It's like setting a drill in forward or reverse before you start drilling.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_32,Let's try that on our old standby - `grep -v blind rhyme`.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_33,"See? We got all the lines *except* the ones with ""blind"". Are you ready for the final step?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_34,"Try to figure it out yourself first - we want to `grep`, inverted (`-v`), looking for ""meow"", in *treasuremeowp*, and send it to a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_35,"All together, that's `grep -v meow treasuremeowp > results`",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_36,"Got it? If your brain feels like it's sweating, you're doing great!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_37,Now the moment of truth - `cat results` to see what we got.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_38,Whoo. I think my brain needs a sports drink...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_39,This looks like another puzzle! Maybe those forward-slashes mean this is a list of directories?,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_40,"Ha! So I *was* right! This is a treasure map, and it's leading us deeper into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_41,We'll tackle that in the next part - come back when you're ready to go find it!,riley,,,
