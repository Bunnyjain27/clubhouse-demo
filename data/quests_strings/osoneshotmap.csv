OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_NAME,The Command-line - Grep... is that a fruit?,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,"Learn about complex command-line tools, and decode a hidden map. (Part 2 of 4)",,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_LAUNCH,"Find the Terminal icon on the desktop, and let's get going!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_1,"Ready to dive back into the Terminal? I hope so, because there's no brakes on this knowledge train, woo woo!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_2,"Ok, that was kinda corny, but I'm getting a big kick out of this. I hope you're having fun too!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_3,"Last time, we used <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> to read a file - and there's another one I want to look at now.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_4,"So, check your prompt - are you still in <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">yarnbasket</span></tt>? If not, let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cd yarnbasket</span></tt> to get in there.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_5,"Now, let's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">ls</span></tt> to see what we've got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_6,"See that file named <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">treasuremeowp</span></tt>? That was what I was looking for - it's got treasure in the name!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_7,Let's see if we can read it - think back to last lesson.,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_8,"Ok, so - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat treasuremeowp</span></tt>, let's see what it says.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_9,"... Thaaat's totally unreadable. Darn. Ha, it reminds me a lot of my last big essay after Felix was done with it!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_10,"Wait, though - Ada gave me a tip after that happened. She told me there was a way to search <b>inside</b> a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_11,"It's a little program called <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> - Ada told me to think of it like a little monster that sifts through files.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_12,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> is like <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt>- it needs a file to work on. Unlike <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt>, it also needs something to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_13,"Let's try a quick example. We'll use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> to look for ""life"" in the file ""rhyme"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_14,"To do that, we type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt>, then the thing we want it to look for (""life""), then the file we want to look in (""rhyme""), which all comes out as <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep blind rhyme</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_15,"There we go, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> returns all the lines in that file that contain the word ""life"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_16,"Let's try that again - find ""blind"" in the file ""rhyme"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_17,"Like before, we type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt>, the word to look for, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">blind</span></tt>, and then the file, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">rhyme</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_18,"So, that's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep blind rhyme</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_19,"Nice. More lines came back, because more lines have that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_20,"Let's look at the entire file to see what we were searching: <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat rhyme</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_21,Heh. That's an... interesting rhyme. o_0,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_22,"Anyway... what if we had a file that was longer than this one? We might want to save the results to a file, so we could look at it later.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_23,"To get <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> to save its output, we use <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&gt;</span></tt>. That tells <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> ""Send your result over there -&gt;"".",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_24,"On the other side of the <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">&gt;</span></tt>, we put the name of the file we want to use. So let's combine that with the last thing we did.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_25,"That should come out as <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep blind rhyme &gt; myfile</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_26,"Now you can type <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat myfile</span></tt> and see the result!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_27,We're almost there - is your brain all tangled up yet? I hope <b>knot</b>! :D,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_28,"The last piece of our puzzle is a tough one - we've used <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt>, but so far we've had to tell it what to look for.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_29,"Remember that file from the beginning, <b>treasuremeowp</b>? (You can <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat</span></tt> it again if you like) It has a ton of ""meow"" in it, but we want everything that <b>isn't</b> that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_30,"Luckily, <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt> has an option we can use to help! <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">-v</span></tt>, for <b>invert</b>. Instead of showing lines with the word we ask for, it shows us all the lines <b>without</b> that word.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_31,"<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">-v</span></tt> goes right after <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt>, but before the search text or file name - It's like setting a drill in forward or reverse before you start drilling.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_32,"Let's try that on our old standby - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep -v blind rhyme</span></tt>.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_33,"See? We got all the lines <b>except</b> the ones with ""blind"". Are you ready for the final step?",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_34,"Try to figure it out yourself first - we want to <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep</span></tt>, inverted (<tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">-v</span></tt>), looking for ""meow"", in <b>treasuremeowp</b>, and send it to a file.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_35,"All together, that's <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">grep -v meow treasuremeowp &gt; results</span></tt>",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_36,"Got it? If your brain feels like it's sweating, you're doing great!",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_37,"Now the moment of truth - <tt><span insert_hyphens=""false"" foreground=""#287A8C"" background=""#FFFFFF"">cat results</span></tt> to see what we got.",riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_38,Whoo. I think my brain needs a sports drink...,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_39,This looks like another puzzle! Maybe those forward-slashes mean this is a list of directories?,riley,,,
OSONESHOTMAP_40,"Ha! So I <b>was</b> right! This is a treasure map, and it's leading us deeper into the file system!",riley,hurray,,
OSONESHOTMAP_41,We'll tackle that in the next part - come back when you're ready to go find it!,riley,,,
