P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_NAME,A Taste of Processing - Learning P5JS,,,,
P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_SUBTITLE,What you'll do,,,,
P5JSINTRO1_QUEST_DESCRIPTION,Take your first steps in coding with P5JS! (Part 1),,,,
P5JSINTRO1_1,"Hey *{{user_name}}*, I've got something *super* cool for you! I've been learning a new programming language for making interactive art - I think it's right up your alley!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_2,"It's called *p5.js* - The ""js"" part comes from *JavaScript* - you've probably heard of it before, it runs on a ton of websites.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_3,"*p5.js* has a live online editor we can use - If it doesn't open automatically, use this link: https://editor.p5js.org/",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_4,"Here's what I've figured out so far: The code is on the left, and the preview is on the right. To run the code, click the play button. Let's try that right now.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_5,"There you go! Not very interesting, but there isn't much there. Let's take a look at the code and see if we can spice it up a bit!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_6,"OK, it looks like there are 2 different parts here - one called `setup()` and the other called `draw()`. It looks like `setup()` creates the place where everything gets drawn, and `draw()` is where the action happens.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_7,"First, we've got to ditch that boring grey background. Change that line to `background('green')` - and be sure you put the quotation marks around the color, it causes an error if you forget.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_8,"I got so many errors when I first started, whoo boy. I hope I can help you avoid some of them! Let's press the *Play* button and see what happens.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_9,"Yay! That's better. Just like with other web languages, you can also use a *hex color* like `#76EECF` or `#FFAA00` instead of a named color. Give it a shot! You can get more info on hex colors at  https://htmlcolorcodes.com/",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_10,"You should have code that reads `background('#76EECF')` (or whatever color you decided on).  If you click play, you should see it in action!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_11,"By the way, if you get tired of clicking play every time, you can click the *Auto-refresh* checkbox and it will refresh for you as you edit!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_12,"Okay, so we've got a background - now comes the real fun! Let's draw a shape on that background - how about a circle?",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_13,"Let's add a new line of code to the `draw()` function. Make sure to add it after `background(...)`, but before the ending `}` so that the program knows it's a part of `draw()`",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_14,"Type `circle(100,200,50);` to draw a circle 100 pixels to the right, 200 pixels down, and 50 pixels in diameter. Don't forget the semicolon (;), that tells the program you're ending that line of code.",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_15,"Try playing around with the numbers in the parentheses to see if you can make your circle bigger or move it right, left, up, and down. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_16,"If you typed a number bigger than 400, your circle probably went off the screen. Remember how in the `setup()` function it says the canvas is 400 x 400?",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_17,Let's make our canvas bigger! Try changing the X and Y values (those two numbers) in the `createCanvas()` function.,riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_18,"I used `createCanvas(600,600)`, BTW. Not too big, but bigger than what we started with. ",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_19,"Nice, with that new canvas size, your bigger circle should show up now! I gotta run, but there's a ton more stuff to show you in *p5.js*!",riley,,,
P5JSINTRO1_20,"Next time, we'll add color to our circle, and make it move around the screen to follow the mouse. Catch you later!",riley,,,
