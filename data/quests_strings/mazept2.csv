MAZEPT2_QUESTION,"You and Faber found the key? That's going to really help us! 
Let's get back into *Sidetrack* and work with Riley so she can get out!",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_QUEST_ACCEPT,"Okay, let's go!",,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH,Launch *Sidetrack*.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LAUNCH_HINT1,Go to the desktop and click on the *Sidetrack* icon.,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP,This key is going to come in so handy! Let's use it to see what's in the coding panel!,,,,
MAZEPT2_FLIP_HINT1,Press the Flip button.,,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS,"Ah. Here are the Instructions. It's the same as the icons on the front, just written in code.

See that! Someone spelled `jump` wrong. No wonder that Instruction doesn't work.

We call that a syntax error. The language has to be super exact. 

So, pay attention to each letter and fix the code. And then try running the level again!",,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT1,"See in the code where it says `jumpp` 

See how it has two p's? There's only one *p* in `jump` only needs one p!",,,,
MAZEPT2_INSTRUCTIONS_HINT2,Change it to say `riley.jump;` Then flip back over and press PLAY.,,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2,"Awesome! That was scary, but thanks to you, I got through.",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B,"Looks like this level has another error, though! Two of them! We need to fix both of them.",,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT1,Look at the Instructions code by flipping the app to the back.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT2,Then look for Instructions that are spelled wrong or that don't match the other Instructions.,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT3,"I see it! `fooorward` has way too many o's!  Change it to `forward`

",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS2_B_HINT4,"Oh, wait, there's another one. Do you see it? Code is case sensitive. 
It should be `jump` not `Jump`",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_FIXANDREORDER,More syntax errors! Someone was in a hurry I guess!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_FIXANDREORDER_FIXED,"Well. I fixed the errors, but I still need to make sure the Instructions are in the right order. 

I better look carefully. Each detail matters if I'm going to get to the exit!",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3,"Hmm, look carefully. There’s no way this set of Instructions could _ever_ finish this level.

But good news, click the Flip button, and you can type any Instructions you want!

This gives you more choice. You don’t have to just rearrange the ones you’re given anymore.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT1,Flip to hack so you can edit the code for Instructions.,Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT2,"Because of that pit in this level, you'll need to add at least one `jump` Instruction.",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT3,Delete one of the Instructions and replace it with `riley.Jump();` ,Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS3_HINT4,"Make sure when you're done that there are 8 Instructions total. No more, no less!",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5,"Hold on, I think – Riley, Do you see that bundle of files?

It's over there, near the Exit! That’s my missing research!",Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_LEVELS5_RILEY,"Whoa, how did...never mind, I'll just go go snap them up right now! ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH1,"Okay, I'm transmitting the files to you now. You should see them soon.

Hope they make it through okay. Things are quite strange in here! ",Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_RESEARCH2,"No problem. We can deal with that. Okay, whew! I'm receiving them now. 

Wow, thanks Riley! You're the best! I really can use these files right now! 

So weird though. I wonder how they got in there? ",Ada,,,

MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_FABER,"Whoa, wait a minute! How's Riley gonna get past a solid column of *Walls* like that?",Faber,,,
MAZEPT2_IMPASSABLE_RILEY,A solid *Wall*! Let's see how we figure this one out! Would love to get out some day soon!,Riley,,,
MAZEPT2_SUCCESS,I think I know what to do. Come meet me in the Clubhouse.,Ada,,,
MAZEPT2_ABORT,Come back whenever you're feeling up for it!,Ada,,,
