2019-09-17,riley,,,@Ada whats the digital version of a flea collar?
2019-09-17,ada,,,@Riley I’d think it’s an antivirus program. Why?
2019-09-17,riley,,,@Ada uhhhhh no reason
2019-09-17,riley,,,@Ada ok I let Felix into my home directory and he totally trashed all my files… and there’s weird ones in here now that I don’t remember saving
2019-09-17,ada,,,@Riley Oh dear… I think you should ask Saniel if there’s anything he can do. @Saniel - Any ideas?
2019-09-17,riley,,,@Ada aaaaa no don’t he TOLD me not to let Felix in
2019-09-17,saniel,,,@Riley The USB key with my strongest antivirals is already in your school mailbox.
2019-09-17,riley,,,@Saniel thanks
2019-09-17,saniel,,,"@Riley No need to thank me… although if you were to free up tomorrow evening, I have quite a few back-issues of the Journal of Computational Linguistics that could use sorting and shelving."
2019-09-17,faber,,,"@Riley don’t tell Saniel, I’ll bring cookies."
2019-09-17,riley,,,@Saniel tomorrow evening it is! Reshelving partyyyyy
2019-09-17,saniel,,,@Riley … Why do I have a sudden premonition of very little actual work occurring?
2019-09-16,faber,,,anybody out there craving some tasty chicken wings? sometimes it just HITS you! #midnightmunchies
2019-09-16,riley,,,@Saniel i heard a rumor about new students???
2019-09-16,saniel,,,"@Riley No Comment. You'll have to be a little more oblique than that, Riley."
2019-09-15,ada,,,Any suggestions for a great tea that goes with physics brain-teasers?
2019-09-15,riley,,,"@Ada lol I wish I could stay awake with tea, gotta be a cafe mocha... mmm chocolate."
2019-09-15,faber,,,@Ada try some passion-fruit rooibos! That stuff'll get you charged up and ready to think big!
2019-09-15,estelle,,,"@Ada I'm a fan of mint tea for almost everything. Soothing, but won't put you to sleep."
2019-09-15,saniel,,,"@Ada Functionally-speaking, tea and coffee are the same - so deca-distilled coffee should help. 3-4 tablespoons can provide hours of heightened energy."
2019-09-15,riley,,,"@Saniel holy jeebers, I gotta get me some of that, imagine how much STUFF I could get done!!!"
2019-09-15,saniel,,,@Riley ... I regret disclosing the existence of this substance.
